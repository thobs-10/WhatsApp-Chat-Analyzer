2020/02/25, 09:18 - +27 82 851 5315: Such drama. Every road out of Uitenhage was blocked with burning with burning tyres. I had prayed before leaving home that nothing would prevent me getting to the airport on time. I left home at 7 and got to check in at 8.55, having parked my car at Kabega as planned. God never stops answering prayer.

Subject: 
*What is the Corona/ Covid-19 Virus Really Teaching us?*
 
I’m a strong believer that there is a spiritual purpose behind everything that happens, whether that is what we perceive as being good or being bad.

As I meditate upon this, I want to share with you what I feel the Corona/ Covid-19 virus is really doing to us:

1) It is reminding us that we are all equal, regardless of our culture, religion, occupation, financial situation or how famous we are. This disease treats us all equally, perhaps we should to. If you don’t believe me,
 just ask Tom Hanks.

2) It is reminding us that we are all connected and something that affects one person has an effect on another. It is reminding us that the false borders that we have put up have little value as this virus does not need a passport. It is reminding us, by oppressing us for a short time, of those in this world whose whole life is spent in oppression.

3) It is reminding us of how precious our health is and how we have moved to neglect it through eating nutrient poor manufactured food and drinking water that is contaminated with chemicals upon chemicals. If we don’t look after our health, we will, of course, get sick.

4) It is reminding us of the shortness of life and of what is most important for us to do, which is to help each other, especially those who are old or sick. Our purpose is not to buy toilet roll.

5) It is reminding us of how materialistic our society has become and how, when in times of difficulty, we remember that it’s the essentials that we need (food, water, medicine)
 as opposed to the luxuries that we sometimes unnecessarily give value to.

6) It is reminding us of how important our family and home life is and how much we have neglected this. It is forcing us back into our houses so we can rebuild them into our home and
 to strengthen our family unit.

7) It is reminding us that our true work is not our job, that is what we do, not what we were created to do.
Our true work is to look after each other, to protect each other and to be of benefit to one another.

8) It is reminding us to keep our egos in check. It is reminding us that no matter how great we think we are or how great others think we are,
a virus can bring our world to a standstill.

9) It is reminding us that the power of freewill is in our hands. We can choose to cooperate and help each other, to share, to give, to help and to support each other or we can choose to be selfish, to hoard, to look after
 only our self. Indeed, it is difficulties that bring out our true colors.

10) It is reminding us that we can be patient, or we can panic. We can either understand that this type of situation has happened many times before in history and will pass, or we can panic and see it as the end of the world and, consequently, cause ourselves more harm than good.

11) It is reminding us that this can either be an end or a new beginning. This can be a time of reflection and understanding, where we learn from our mistakes, or it can be the start of a cycle which will continue until we finally learn the lesson we are meant to.

12) It is reminding us that this Earth is sick. It is reminding us that we need to look at the rate of deforestation just as urgently as we look at the speed at which toilet rolls are disappearing off of shelves. We are sick because our home is sick. 

13) It is reminding us that after every difficulty, there is always ease. Life is cyclical, and this is just a phase in this great cycle. We do not need to panic; this too shall pass.

14) Whereas many see the Corona/ Covid-19 virus as a great disaster, I prefer to see it as a *great corrector*

It is sent to remind us of the important lessons that we seem to have forgotten and it is up to us if we will learn them or not.

2020/03/24, 08:12 - +27 82 851 5315: Finally! South Africa goes on lockdown. I sent out advice to a few friends last week but I am happy to share it with everyone.

SHOPPING:  firstly you don't need to be a complete drama queen with stock piling (your country is not going to run out of stock), but you do need to buy enough so that you don't need to shop every 2nd or 3rd day. Lockdown is not the time you want to be at the shops, touching siff trolley handles and walking on floors and touching stuff that people have sneezed and coughed on. So buy enough for 10 days. I have shopped twice in 11 days (I usually shop every 2nd day). 

Go through EVERY room in your home. Look at the consumables in each room. Fancy hair salon shampoo? Buy a spare now. Trust me, check every room. Open every cupboard. Make a list. 

Don't forget cleaning stuff.  Especially antibacterial surface sprays. Your domestics won't be coming to work, you need to check all cleaning supplies because you don't want to live in a pigsty! If you have never cleaned your own toilets be warned, you need to buy toilet cleaner.

The rest of the world shops online. Maybe now is the time for SA to embrace the online shopping trend? 

FOOD: kids eat 5 or 6 times a day. Especially if they are bored. Freeze ready made pizzas or bases, rolls, french loaf, bread, buy pasta on mass, ready made sauces, frozen vegetables. Rice cakes, wraps, cereal. I know most of this is carbs but now is when you need easy meals. 

I have noticed a shortage of yoghurts, grated cheese and long life milk in my local shop in Spain. Don't forget water or water filter. 

MEDICAL: paracetamol for 2 months. Do you have a working digital thermometer? Cholesterol meds, all your normal pills x 2 months. Gloves and masks (for wearing when when you go shopping and in case 1 of you get sick). Handsoaps for each bathroom and the kitchen, make sure you have enough. 

EXERCISE: lockdown = no gym, no runs outside. Get yoga mats. Buy weights. Get a skipping rope. If you are feeling flush get a treadmill or stationery bike. If you have young kids and a big garden maybe buy stuff like cones and hoops to set out obstacle courses in your garden.

COSMETICS : colour your hair tomorrow! Get your gel nails soaked off, tomorrow.

PETS: any meds your pets take, also fancy food from the vet. Flea treatments.

DIY: anything you will need for DIY projects. Paint? Plants? Arts and crafts stuff.

STATIONERY : printer ink and paper.

RECREATION : puzzles, board games, books. Now might be the right time to get a kindle.  Maybe colouring in books? Canvas and paint?

GARDEN: stuff to keep your pool clean, wood, gas, blitz, candles, lighters.

COMMUNITY : get in touch with your elderly neighbours, get their phone numbers. Check in regularly.

Tell your neighbours when you are at the shops, pick up anything they need. Drop it at their front door. 

Get to grips with technology. Zoom is great, I had my 1st Zoom chat last night with 3 friends.    Its for free. Whatsapp also has free video calls. 

SANITY: have a routine, talk to your friends all day, schedule Friday night bubbles, no need to stop your Wednesday morning coffee just do it online (Zoom / WhatsApp), don't watch the news, if you feel overwhelmed then turn your cell onto silent and take a break from social media. Make a list of what you'd like to do. Clean out all your cupboards? Sort out your photos? Learn yoga? Try new recipes? Learn how to draw? The options are endless. Don't spend all day watching TV. You will end up sad and depressed. If everyone is stuck at home everyone needs to share chores. Mom cannot do everything. That is not fair. Get a chore chart going.

Have a good attitude, this is not the end of the world. Now is not the time for anyone to attain perfection, its the time to just do your best under weird circumstances. Keep your sense of humour. We are 11 days in (I think, its tough to keep track) and I can honestly say we are fine, as a married couple and as a family. I have laughed more in these 11 days than I have in a long time, its really all about your attitude. So good luck and also, don't be an ass, stay at home.

2020/03/27, 08:30 - +27 82 851 5315: 📖 Ecclesiastes 8:4

‘The word of the King is powerful!’

- The words of earthly kings are powerful.
- But the words of the King of Kings are infallible.
- In a world of fake news and rumours, we should depend on HIS words.
- Believe what God says and leave the rest to the ‘test of time’.

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, I look to You and Your words. I will not be swayed by all I hear and see, but I will place my trust and confidence in You. I believe what You say and that settles it!in the Name of Jesus. Amen www.AlivetoGod.com

Enlarge the pictures & touch the birds, you can  listen their tunes    🦜🦜🦜
Just enlarge  the frame to see the birds clearly.

Touch ( *only !*, don’t press to long) any bird and you'll hear its call.

2020/04/09, 13:06 - +27 82 851 5315: The brilliant Axel Scheffler has produced a book about Covid-19 Coronavirus just for children - and it's available as a FREE download.  Please share so it's available to every family who needs it.

https://nosycrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Coronavirus_INS.pdf

The Gruffalo illustrator worked with consultant Professor Graham Medley, two head teachers and a psychologist to make sure the book got the messages right, answering questions about quarantine, how you can catch the virus and what happens if you get ill.

He too confirms that we will only know when school can open once the government has finalised it's plan and it has been formally  announced - probably by our President himself. Therefore please don't listen to all the talk about what  MIGHT  or MAY  happen. Rather wait for the final decision and announcement. Please share this with your children and with other parents.
 Please continue to keep your children best home where they will be safe.
 Let them watch the reports about the Coronavirus  and  see the results for themselves to help them understand just how vitally important the lockdown is. 
Please keep praying. 
Stay safe. Stay at home.

- The enemy would like to see us rattled and worried.
- But we should take up our positions and stand firm.
- Don’t give in to fear, for the Lord has a plan of deliverance for you!

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, forgive me for allowing fear to shake and disturb me. I will trust in You and I will not be afraid, for You will deliver me, in the Name of Jesus. Amen www.AlivetoGod.com

2020/04/23, 08:48 - +27 82 851 5315: 📖 Exodus 17:6    (TLB)

‘I (the Lord) will meet you there at the rock.’

- Desperate times call for desperate measures.
- The people of God had no water, and in their desperation, God met them.
- We all need to reach that moment when we meet God for ourselves.
- It is there, face to face with Him, that He will make a way for us.

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, today, I stand here ready to meet You. I am Your child and I need a miracle in my situation, and in the situation that the world is facing currently. Make a way for me, I pray, make a way for humanity, I ask, in the Name of Jesus. Amen www.AlivetoGod.com

2020/04/24, 10:21 - +27 82 851 5315: Ps... A clever child will get bored with the game and not stick out tongue on command 🤣
2020/04/24, 10:21 - +27 82 851 5315: A child learns every waking second... From birth.... This tongue is the proof 🥰
2020/04/24, 10:21 - +27 82 851 5315: If there is no tongue response the child is ill or one has to do further testing.
2020/04/24, 10:21 - +27 82 851 5315: I just know it as part of my testing. So many years ago that I forget the link or reference. I'll search later though.

The first indication of Intelligence is to do the tongue test. If the child responds by copying the action all other learning is taking place. Based on the genius program it can then be presumed that all words, actions and so forth are understood by the child and will be used as and when development of the body and muscles allow. The brain is much faster than the rest of the body. An example given is the word 'doggie'... Look at the doggie. Whether you say Dalmatian, or pit bull the child will remember and  utilise that word. Although baby talk is cute and conveys love which is vital, speech, sight and sounds early give a child a huge head start. Hence the perception that some children are genius on piano, dance, maths, etc.... They were introduced very young, sometimes before birth, and this stimuli is what taught them.

From 1950 to 1953 Ivan Denisovich was held prisoner in a Soviet forced labour camp. During his time there he noticed that one of his fellow prisoners had a light in his eyes that others didn’t. Somehow he managed to keep his spirits up while most of the others appeared broken and dispirited. In his book, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, Denisovich tells the story of how every night before the glimmering bulb was turned off, that man would reverently unfolds some wrinkled pieces of paper that had somehow escaped the censor. On them were copied passages from the Gospels. The scriptures were what gave the prisoner strength and endurance deep in the darkest corner behind the Iron Curtain.

In today’s gospel, we meet two of Jesus’ disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24: 13-35). We get the sense that they are battling to understand what has just happened. They had thrown in their lot with Jesus and were excited at the promise and hope he had offered for a better world, a better life – a world that reflected God’s values of justice, peace and joy.

All that seemed to come crashing down when Jesus was arrested, tried and condemned to death. Their hopes were shattered. They were devastated and just wanted to run away – leaving Jerusalem behind, and all that had happened there. It is easy to believe in God, to have faith and hope when things are running smoothly, but what happens when darkness clouds over, when trusted habits don’t seem to work anymore, when we feel too far gone to even try.

It is into this situation of darkness and disappointment – this place of lost hopes and broken dreams that Jesus enters - not simply as Jesus of Nazareth, but as the risen Lord, powerful and empowering. Oddly the two on the road do not recognise him, but nevertheless feel comfortable enough to tell their story. As they recount the events of the last few days, we hear the source of their pain. They tell their new companion “Our own hope had been that he would be the one to set Israel free.” Our own hope had been … How many times have our hopes been dashed, our hopes for a healthy marriage … our hopes for a better relationship with our family … our hope of overcoming an illness, an addiction, a bad habit … our hope for a better job, a better lifestyle  … our hopes not only for ourselves, but for others also? How many times have we wanted to walk away?  
As they walk along, the stranger opens up the scriptures and helps the two to see their story in a new light. It is interesting that Jesus takes them back to the scriptures, because all too often when things go wrong, we are inclined to walk away from our faith. When Jesus opens the scriptures he helps the two, and us, to see that in fact the cross is part of life, it is part of our journey – and not necessarily the end. Struggle is part of life – and it often comes uninvited, as does pain and death, grief and disappointment, hurt and disillusionment. When we stand on the threshold of such uncertainties it is easy to waiver, to give in to the darkness, but Jesus assures us that what dwells beyond our uncertainty is not simply chaos, but new possibilities.

In the chapter before today’s gospel Luke records the death of Jesus. He includes the detail that “It was now about the sixth hour and the sun's light failed, so that darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.” There are echoes here of the creation story where we hear that “the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.” (Genesis 1:2) In other words, just as God brought life out of chaos in the moment of creation, so the spirit of God hovers over the darkness of the world and brings forth Jesus’ resurrection. So also the Spirit of God hovers over the fragments of our life, our uncertainties and our disillusionments and has power to work a resurrection there too.

While we cannot receive the eucharist at this time, we can encounter the risen Christ when we turn to the scriptures. Just as the prisoner drew life from the gospel, so too we can draw life from God’s word. It is there that we encounter the same Spirit of power that raised Jesus from the dead, the Spirit of power promised us by Jesus himself. So when we are visited by moments of doubt, remember that we are not alone. The Spirit of God is at work, hovering over us so to speak, ready to bring forth new life.
May the Lord continue to bless you in the week ahead and fill you with the power and strength that you need at this time. God’s blessing an love, Fr Jerry

2020/04/27, 08:44 - +27 82 851 5315: 📖 Exodus 17:12

‘Moses’ arms soon became so tired he could no longer hold them up. So, Aaron and Hur found a stone for him to sit on. Then they stood on each side of Moses, holding up his hands.’

- This is a time when we need to help others and hold up their hands.
- It is not a time to be selfish and self-centred.
- If you see someone who you are able to help, extend a helping hand.
- When we help each other, it sets us up for victory and success.

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, may my life be used by You at this time. May I be someone who lifts the loads that others are carrying and may You send the right person to hold up my arms, I pray, in the Name of Jesus. Amen www.AlivetoGod.com

She asked me to not send her the pastor's  video any longer. She really enjoys it but she calculated that in one month she had spent R1000 on data! It made me think. At home I am blessed with uncapped internet use but not everyone else is. If data is a challenge for you please let me know if you would like any changes made in what you receive. It doesn't mean leaving the group. I will instead send the video to individuals on their own number. Please Stay safe and  Stay well.

In his book The Power Within Us Russell Nelson tells the story of a woman that he met when he was making a professional house call. The ravages of polio had effectively destroyed all the muscles that helped the woman breath so that her life was completely dependent on a ventilating machine - a large metal lung that she had to lay inside in order to survive. While there Nelson recalls how he watched her three children as they related to their mother. “The oldest interrupted our work to ask permission to go to a friend's house for an hour. Later the second child asked her mother for help with arithmetic. Finally the youngest child, so small that she couldn't see her mother's face directly, looked up at the mother's image in a mirror that had been placed over her head and asked, "Mommy, may I have a cookie?" I've never forgotten that lesson on the power of love. This woman, virtually disabled and certainly incapable of any degree of physical enforcement of parental authority, sweetly influenced that home solely with the power to love.”

Love is an invisible power that is at work constantly in our lives. Think of how it has impacted on your life. Think of its power, its ability to bring about change, its willingness to protect, to shelter, to forgive, to influence the course of your life? Love gives wings to our dreams and encourages us to be all that we are meant to be. Of course there are also times in life when love’s power is stymied because of a hurt or a betrayal. It is perhaps then, in those moments of loss, that we understand most acutely that we were indeed made for love and that without love we are a shadow of who we are meant to be.    

When we look to Jesus’ life, we get some insight as to why this might be. In his first letter John writes that “God is Love … (1 John 4:9). In the first chapter of Genesis we are reminded that we are “made in God’s image and likeness” (Genesis 1:26). We have been made for love, it is the life force that animates our lives. When we act from a place of love, it is then that we are most God-like - being who we are called to be, meant to be.

In today’s gospel when Jesus makes the statement “If you love me … (John 14: 15-21) he is drawing our attention to the heart of the Gospel - Love. Notice that he puts the emphasis on love rather than the law. He says “If you love me you will keep my commandments.” Without love the law becomes a restraint, something to be railed against, a hindrance to our freedom, something to find a way around, but with love it becomes understandable, something that is acceptable, even beneficial, because it recognises than in order for each one of us to thrive, we must all thrive.

Love connects us in a way that nothing else can. It leads to unity and a concern for the other that always leads to selfless action. When love shapes our relationships, it changes how we see the other. Think of the mother who will go hungry so that her child will have food – that is love. Or the father who will put his life in danger to protect a family member – that is love. Or the spouse who will go the extra mile to make sure that their partner is happy – that is love.

This willingness to help close family members or a loved one is meant to ripple beyond the confines of our immediate household to the broader community. Jesus spends his life helping people to make this connection, helping us to recognise the dignity of others, to live in harmony with our brothers and sisters and the environment that we share with God.

In describing the intimate relationship between Jesus and His father, and the promise of Jesus to send the Holy Spirit, the advocate, today’s gospel emphasises the importance of community and the interconnection between the spiritual life of God and the physical life that we experience at this time. It is the invisible power of God’s love that enlivens our existence and helps us grow towards maturity and wholeness.  

Our journey towards wholeness is the work of a lifetime and involves a willingness in ourselves to open our lives to the light of the Holy Spirit. It is only as we begin to let go of the things that blind us to love, our prejudices, our hurts, our addictions, the mistakes of our past, the bad choices that we have made, that we can truly grow into the people that God wants us to be. We are not alone in this work. Jesus promises us that the Holy Spirit, the same Spirit who raised Jesus from the dead, will be with us. With his power at work in our lives all things are possible.

May the week ahead be a time of healing and love as the Holy Spirit helps us to see with the eyes of Christ and to know that we are loved unconditionally by God.

‘I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you COMPLETELY with joy and peace because you trust in Him.’

- Anxiety, distress, and dread are the rewards for entertaining fear.
- Hope, joy, and peace are the rewards of trusting in the Lord.
- Hope, joy, and peace can be our reality as we believe in Him.
- We can choose, fear or trust, and we can enjoy the associated rewards.

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, as from today, I will not live by fear, but I choose to live a life of believing and trusting in You. Fill me with Your peace, Your joy, and Your hope, and may my life overflow with hope, in the Name of Jesus. Amen www.AlivetoGod.com

2020/05/24, 07:11 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Ascension Sunday - 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

Jesus’ life, death and resurrection changed the course of human history. It changed how we see ourselves, how we see each other and how we see God. In Jesus, humanity came to a fuller understanding of what it means to be human and what it means to share in the life of God. In him we recognise a nobler calling for our lives, a truth about who we are meant to be that calls us out of the shadows into the fullness of the light, so that we might know our true dignity as people of God.

Without God we wander aimlessly through life searching for a meaning and purpose that continually eludes us. We end up exalting ourselves, and a few others who look like us, in a vain effort to give value to our lives, all the while ignoring the pain and destruction that our selfish quest inflicts. In a God-less society greed and envy and pride and lust for power are not seen as vices, but as tools to nudge us towards self-fulfilment. Think of how often men and women have been exploited, or denigrated, or cast aside, or trampled upon, or even been bought and sold by fellow human beings in a futile attempt to gain and hold power? Or how human structures, rules and customs have been used to manipulate and control groups and individuals, while promoting and protecting the few? Or how companies and businesses have plundered the earth’s resources, often exploiting local people and their lands in the process, while greedily accumulating wealth and power. 

Blindly we look outside of ourselves for answers that are not to be found there, while ignoring the mystery within. St Augustine sums it up so accurately when he says “You have formed us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless till they find rest in you.”

The longing within us for something more, something beyond ourselves is powerful. It is as if there is something missing that only the one who created us can fulfil. The Christian story is the answer to that longing. In Jesus we encounter the heart of God and in doing so we encounter our true selves. He is the one who redeems us, liberates us, from the false illusions that we can go it alone. His life and mission was to restore us to our original splendour, to help us find our way home to God, to ourselves and to one another.

In his farewell discourse at the time of the last Supper, Jesus tells his disciples that he is going to the father’s house to prepare a place for them. His ascension is the culmination of his life’s mission and not only opens up the way for us to follow, but restores a union that had been shattered through sin. Being at one with God again invites us to live differently, in
 a way that reflects God’s love in the world.

This is reinforced at the close of Matthews Gospel, when Jesus shares his mission with us. He command us to “Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.”(Matt 28: 19-20). In other words, Jesus invites us to live as he has lived, to see in every man and every woman the image of God and not to be blinded by the prejudices of an unjust society that measures a person in terms of their financial worth or social status. The great commission invites us to build each other up, rather than break each other down, to help each other reach our potential, rather than be threatened by the fact that the person next to us has different gifts to ourselves.

He has promised in the Acts of the Apostles that we will not be alone in this work but that we will “receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon us” (Acts 1:8). 

This promise of the Holy Spirit offers us the gifts of wisdom and right judgement to guide our lives as we carry out Jesus’ mission.
As individuals and communities we are called to live with justice and compassion, rather than be drawn into the false promises of a God-less world.

So today as we celebrate this feast of the Ascension, let us pray for the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives so that we may be even more courageous in the way we live our faith. Let this feast day serve to remind us of our commitment to the vision of Jesus which is to build God’s Kingdom on right relationships, peace, justice and love, while respecting the divine in each other. Let us go forward in our mission to make a difference in the world, confident in Jesus’s promise to be with us till the end of time.

2020/05/31, 07:40 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Pentecost Sunday - Cycle A, 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne
 
Almost every day when we turn on the news or open our social media accounts we are inundated with messages of intolerance, discrimination, prejudice, xenophobia, racism or gender bias, sometimes wearing the veneer of humour but more often than not expressing some rage or anger that has been unleashed or a bias that lies just beneath the surface.

From our earliest years the way we see ourselves and the world around us is shaped by the social, family or ethnic group that we are born into. The way we talk about and describe others, the images we use, the way we group people together reinforces a particular narrative that sets us apart and gives us permission to maintain the status quo. Think for a moment of how our assumptions about gender, age, ethnicity or race limits our expectations of the other; how our ‘humour’ reinforces our bias; how few people who are ‘different’ from us are part of our circle of friends. This is why we have intolerance, discrimination and prejudice – because we don’t know or understand each other. We choose to live in, and perpetuate, a fractured society as long as we cling to the lie that ‘we’ are better, often oblivious to the pain and humiliation that our thoughts and actions cause. The reality is that we are all interconnected. As Margaret Wheatley, author and management consultant writes Everything in the universe only exists because it is in relationship to everything else. Nothing exists in isolation. We have to stop pretending we are individuals that can go it alone.”

There is another way. It involves us trusting Christ and being willing to embrace the gifts and the life that he offers. That’s not easy to do, because it means letting go of one way of living, so that we can take on something even greater. 

When Jesus entered our human condition he found a fractured world, a world that had broken its ties with God, a world that had established social structures that valued one person more than another, a world where wealth and power and status were the measure of a man or woman and not what was in a person’s heart.
Jesus turned that world on its head. He preached and lived a message of equality. His life proclaimed the dignity of all people most notably when he sat at table with the sinner and the outcast. In offering the gifts of reconciliation and healing, he restored humanity’s dignity and helped us find our way back to God and one another. The life that Jesus lived is carried on in the early Church as we hear in the Acts of the Apostles

In today’s text (Acts 2:1-11) we hear about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the apostle in Jerusalem and how they began to proclaim the glory of God. The people gathered, from every nation under heaven, are united in their admiration and astonishment at what is possible through the power of the Holy Spirit. This Pentecost event is the exact reversal of the story of the Tower of Babel (Genesis 11:1-9) In the Babel story the people who had been in complete harmony, began building a tower to heaven, but fell our among themselves. They had lost their focus on God with disastrous consequences, ending in division and discord. At Pentecost the Holy Spirit helps people find a common voice again.

In today’s second reading (1 Cor 12:3b-7 12-12) and in (Gal 3:28) we see Paul continuing Jesus’ message of equality when he writes “There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus”. We are one in Christ. Take away the labels and we find a fellow human being just like ourselves, trying their best to live the best life possible. Somehow this is a message that the world has failed to hear.

But it doesn’t have to be like that. As Christians we have received the same Holy Spirit that fell on the apostles at Pentecost. Jesus comes and stands in our midst and sends us forth. “As the father sent me, so I send you.” He sends us into the world armed with the knowledge and assurance of His Love and empowered with the gifts of the Holy Spirit and asks us to make a difference.

Today, as much as any time in the past, the world needs a Pentecost and it needs people to model another way of living. As people of God, we know the way. We know the life that we are called to live. Let us pray for the insight and understanding that we need to see what prevents us from living that life and the courage and strength to overcome it.

Come Holy Spirit, enkindle in us the fire of your love. Send forth your spirit and we shall be created, and you shall renew the face of the earth.

In them he has set a tent for the sun, which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber, and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy. Its rising is from the end of the heavens, and its circuit to the end of them, and there is nothing hidden from its heat." Psalm 19vs1-19

The revelation of God, that is the way God makes himself known to us as created beings, can be broadly classified into either " *His General Revelation"* - that would be all that could be seen and known about God from the created world around us, and " *His special Revelation"* - that which He specifically reveals to us through His written word (The Bible)

As we continue in days that hold with in them innormous uncertainty about the future, one thing remains certain and secure. That is the "anchor" we have in God's  faithful continued revelation of Himself, reminding us that He is with us and is there to lead and guide us, if only we would turn to Him.

In this time of crises, many have turned to surfing the  internet, watching movies on line, playing mindless games on their phones, trying to fill their time with new creative activities with in the confines of the home - most times as a form of escapism and a way to pass the time until things return to "normal"

Now the reality is setting in that life as we new it will more than likely never be the same. This realization has brought with it a whole new set of anxieties, - mental anguish, depression and continual worry.

If you are finding yourself in this space - take courage and look to the Lord and His continued faithful revelation of Himself. 

Every morning for the passed 2 months I have had the privalage of being able to witness some of the most amazing and spectacular  sunrises I have seen in a long time. This is not because there haven't been any before this, but perhaps the truth is I have just been to busy to notice. Every time I see the sun rise, my thoughts are drawn to this Psalm, and there is a reminder of God's faithfulness in the revelation of Himself to us His people.

I enjoy photography, and one of the things I like to capture is a  sunrise. Those that know anything about this type of photography will know that you only have about 15-30seconds to get that perfect photo at just the right time when the lighting is just right. 

In order to capture this it means that you need to get up when it is dark, set up your equipment, and wait patiently for that perfect moment when "God" reveals His glory and something of Himself in another perfect sunrise and  start to a new day.

THOUGHT,

For us as believers it is easy to become distracted by what is happening around us. We can also turn to many activities as a form of escapism to some how avoid reality, and minimize our fealings of anxiety and worry.

But just like we are sometimes to busy to notice the sunrise (or even when it is perhaps hidden from us by clouds), the truth is it will rise and continue to rise wether we take time to wait for that perfect 15-30seconds or not.

Likewise with our God He faithfully continues to reveal himself to the world each new day. Just look at creation all around us, it is a testimony to the one true God, our God. The question is are you taking  the time to be still before Him and wait patiently  for what He wants to reveal to you today and each new day.

I can assure you with confidence and experience, that when you take the time out each new day to wait upon the the Lord, and hear and discover what He wants to reveal to you about himself - it will radically reduce your levels of anxiety, worry and fear.

" _We have a God who's mercies are new every morning, great is his faithfulness."_ 

Have a blessed day😊

As mentioned yesterday here we have 6 statements, each in parallel,  describing the Word of God, and it's effect and change it will bring about on those that would receive it and take heed to it.

 *What other scriptures have to say:* 

 "All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work." 2 Tim 3vs16-17

 "For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart." Heb  4vs12

THOUGHT,

In life when it comes to operating a new appliance, trying out some new software, obtaining a new electronic gadget, etc... there generally appear to be two groups of people - those that will first read the instruction manual and then begin to use the product in a very satisfying and rewarding manner. And then there is the second group who choose to first go on the longer, more frustrating journey of self discovery,  and then when they are either really stuck or frustrated will turn to the manual. How ever when they do, they will do a speed read of the contents and only refer to the section that they feel pertains to them.

I am not sure which categorie you would find yourself.

When it comes to God's word I have observed amongst believers we appear to have a similar two categories of people. Those that will willingly feed and meditate on the word of God daily, leading to the reward of a deeper relationship with God and deeper understanding and appreciation of the nature and person of God. This also results in a far more fulfilled and content life as they journey with God.

And then we have those that will only turn to His word in times of crises, frustration or trial - and then if we want to be entirely honest all they are looking for is the 'quick fix" to get them past their current situation - there is no real desire to go deaper and really discover and know the things of God.

So let me ask you, "which categorie do you find yourself?"

 *The Psalmist continues in vs10 -11* 
 _More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and drippings of the honeycomb. Moreover, by them is your servant warned; in keeping them there is great reward._ 

Have a blessed day😊

2020/06/07, 07:14 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Trinity Sunday - Cycle A, 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne
 
Today we celebrate Trinity Sunday. At the beginning of Mass and indeed at the beginning of every prayer, we Catholics bless ourselves in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. This gesture is a constant reminder of our baptism and an acknowledgment of our belief in a triune God. While the mystery of the trinity leaves us much to contemplate, one of the aspects we find easier to understand is the idea of relationship.

Our very existence is defined by who we are in relation to others. Just think about some of the best experiences in your life. Inevitable, you will find that they involves someone that had a special place in your life like a lover, a friend, a parent or a sibling, someone that you could open up to and be completely yourself, or someone who appreciates you and shares some of the values, belief’s and outlook on life that give meaning to your existence. The experience in itself doesn’t have to be anything spectacular, but is made special because of who it is shared with.

On the other hand, some of the worst times in your life have probably been when you felt abandoned, betrayed or cut off from someone who is important to you. The sense of rejection or isolation weighs heavily on us and can leave us feeling depressed and deeply unhappy.

Our need for relationship goes to the core of our existence and perhaps makes sense when we contemplate the relational nature of God in whose image we are made. At the heart of God we find a community of love, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Our desire for companionship, our need to get a hug or an embrace from time to time, our craving for love and the deep longing of our soul for communion, is a constant reminder of our origins, and a deep affirmation that we are made in God’s likeness.

Just as the community of God knows and loves one another, so we are called to be people of love who treat each other with dignity and respect. In the Trinity there is no seeking of power where one dominates another, but rather a sharing in a creative power that is based on mutuality and trust that brings forth life. How different our world, our society, our families our marriages, our relationships could be if we took time to dig deeper and find our true selves rather than living on the surface where we measure our worth on what we wear or how we look.

Real love, trinitarian love, is self-giving and only looks for the benefit of the other. In our gospel reading today, we see that self-giving love when “God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him might not perish but might have eternal life.” (John 3:16). Time and again we see this love manifest in the life of Jesus. It is evident in his care and compassion for others, in his respect for the person rather than the role, in his desire for healing and reconciliation, in his ability to welcome the stranger and to include those on the margins of society. He showed us that real love has no bounds.

The way of Jesus is an invitation to a way of living, loving, and relating that reflects a community of equals. It is found in the very ordinary ways that we offer each other love, care and forgiveness. It is also to be found when we raise our voices in condemnation in the face of injustice and inequality and when we stand in solidarity with the poor and the oppressed. There is no freedom when all are not free. There is no equality when all are not considered equal.

If we believe in a Trinitarian God, then each of us has a choice to make about how we live. We must hold fast to the truth that God is community and that we are at our best when we reach out to one another in mutual respect and love. We should never be afraid to do what is right because it is only then that we can begin to heal our world and ourselves. At a deep level we are meant to be people of the truth and when we ignore that reality we wound our soul. We are not alone in this great quest, because Jesus has given us the gift of the Holy Spirit, the one who is our strength. It is the spirit that guides us and gives us the  courage and wisdom we need to make the world a better place. So as we celebrate this great feast, let us allow ourselves to be held and experience once again the healing love of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Tom Brown’s Schooldays is a novel written in 1857 by Thomas Hughes. It is based on his own experiences as a student at an English boarding School. One day a new boy joined the school and was assigned a bunk in the same dormitory as Tom Brown and ten other boys. As the new boy got ready for bed on his first night, he knelt down to say his prayers. As soon as he did, the boys started making fun of him. Tom noticed a heavy shoe flying in the air to hit the praying boy - but it missed his head. Laughter and ridicule followed. The incident shook Tom so much so that he could not sleep for some time. He remembered his own first night at the school, and how when he knelt and prayed, he too was ridiculed. He kept thinking of his mother and the prayers she had taught him, prayers he had not said since that first night that he came to the school. Over the next few days the newcomer continued to kneel and pray, despite the constant ridicule. Then one evening, encouraged by his example and determination, Tom also knelt down to pray. The other boys who planned to bully the new boy yet again, noticed what their leader and champion was doing and immediately withdrew with respectful silence. One young man’s commitment to his faith influenced another and he in his turn influenced some more. Something as simple as kneeling and praying became a witness that won the respect and admiration of the entire class.

Today’s gospel is all about witness. It begins with the exhortation “Fear no one” probably because fear is the most inhibiting factor in all our lives. The context for the passage has to do with the fact that Jesus is preparing to send his disciples out on mission, so he is preparing them for what lies ahead. He is warning them that the authorities will give them a hard time, that there is a great chance that they will suffer physical violence and will be ridiculed by people who will call them names and even accuse them of blasphemy and possibly treason.

Jesus is clear that the way of life that he is proposing is radically different from the status quo. He knows that this has already gotten himself on the wrong side of the religious and political leaders of the day. It is revolutionary in its focus in that it challenges the social constructs of society, exposing the prejudices and biases that have held people captive to a way of life that is contrary to God’s plan. As he encouraged his followers with the words “do not be afraid” Jesus makes it clear that there will indeed be a cost to discipleship. The way of life that he proposes will involve a lot of soul searching and reform that asks people to live beyond the blinkered confines of their current existence, something that most people are reluctant to do, so the disciples must expect resistance and anger.

In effect Jesus is sending his followers on a mission that will change the world. If the radical new life that Jesus is proposing is to become a reality it can’t be something that his followers whisper among themselves - but must be proclaimed from the housetops. Is it any wonder that they were afraid? The disciples will need to be strong and courageous as they challenge people to live according to the nobler plan that God has for the world.

In a way it is easy to look at the disciples of Jesus and be grateful for the choices that they made when it comes to how they responded to his call. We can admire them from a distance and be thankful for their courage, their commitment and their witness. But where does that leave us? If we are to be true followers of Jesus now, do we need to examine the presumptions and norms that we have come to accept? Is it possible that we have fallen into a comfortable existence that cloaks our lives from the reality of others pain, from their misfortune or from an attitude that sets us apart? Are there people that we need to walk away from, outlooks that we need to re-examine? Has the time come when we need to kneel on our own, when we need to set aside our fears and the opinions of others so that we can stand up for the gospel? The life of Jesus reminds us that one person can change the world. When we let go of our fear and practice our capacity for courage, when we stand up for what is right, even when we are standing alone, we can make all the difference.

I want to finish with a prayer by Thomas Merton, one of the great Catholic authors of our time, who recognizes that the call to discipleship is not always easy, but that when we trust in God we are not alone. He writes “I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end… I know that you will lead me by the right road, though I may know nothing about it. Therefore, I trust you always; I will not fear for you are with me; and you never leave me to face my perils alone.”

   ~ by Russ and Kitty Walden

"The Father says today that My love is surrounding you like a shield of strength this day. My love has parameters in your life.

My love has depth and height and length in your day this day. My love stands guard over you today. My love is superintending every need that you have.

My love is populating the empty shelves and filling every void in your life to the full with My goodness and My favor.

All of the hatred of the enemy and the rage of the enemy cannot penetrate the love that I have surrounded you with.

Though the enemy would spend the whole of his fury upon you he would not penetrate in the slightest manner the protecting influence of My love around you now.

So go out in your day and be the beloved. Know that at the end of your day My love and the dividends of My love will put you over and give you peace. Be at peace My beloved.

Your job is not to rail against the enemy. Honestly do you think he will listen? The whole of Satan's fury against you is the small dust of the balance of My great love wherewith I love you this day.

I know this isn't what you have been taught but make up your mind to be a Father-pleaser and a Kingdom-seeker.

I am seeking those who worship Me without looking over their shoulder to see what the defeated one is planning next. It is MY plan and not the work of the enemy that is shaping your future - so rejoice!

Have a blessed day!🌸💖

Some years ago, Sam Foss, a writer and traveller, was taking a walk in the countryside when he came across a little house on the side of a lane. As he came close to the house there was a signpost that read: “Help yourself to a cool drink.” Not far away he found a spring of ice-cold water with a jug nearby to help draw the water. Alongside the stream there was a bench with a basket of summer apples and another sign inviting the passers-by to help themselves. Curious about the people who showed such hospitality to strangers, Foss knocked at the door.

An elderly couple answered, and Foss asked them about the well and the apples. They explained that they were childless. Their little plot of ground barely yielded a living, but because they had a well with an abundance of cold water, they just wanted to share it with anyone who happened to pass by. The husband mentioned that they were too poor to give money to charity, but that offering a cup of cold water to those that passed by brought its own reward.

There is something about the practice of hospitality that one might say is essential to the human spirit. It is the fruit of an action that at once helps the beneficiary while enriching the giver. Sometimes it cost nothing, while at others it involves sacrifice. Even though hospitality is an essential part of our nature, there is at times a reluctance within us, an urge towards self-preservation perhaps, or maybe it is a fear that when we give that we will be diminished, that inhibits our outreach. The opposite in fact is the truth. In order to experience love we have to trust, we have to open our self to the other. In the act of trusting, love can blossom in a way that benefits not only the one who is loved, but also the one who takes the risk to trust. Or think of how at times we are reluctant to complement a work colleague, a friend or a family member – for whatever reason. When we step over that reluctance and give the complement we can see how it benefits the recipient, but we also discover a kind of serenity within ourselves that in essence is an affirmation that what we have done is the right thing.

True hospitality is an innate desire, a longing within us to reach beyond ourselves, to be in communion with those we meet and to discover what a world free of fear has to offer. In a real way it echoes the community of love that is God as it reverberates within us and calls us to the fullness of life. True hospitality doesn’t fear what is different but allows for new ideas and possibilities. It is open to the reality that what we take in to our lives has the potential to change us while at the same time understanding that without new people and new ideas, we are compelled to live in an ever diminishing world.

In today’s gospel Jesus says “Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me …” and “Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it …” (Matthew 10:37-42). Could it be that he is calling us out of the limited thinking that is often associated with family and culture, to a new way of looking at life? How often does our family story, or our cultural background cast dispersions on those who look different to us, or those who speak a different language, or come from a different social class? If we are unwilling to consider that ours is not the full story, or worse again that we assert that our perspective in life is the fulness of the truth, we might well find a certain comfort in our assertions for a time – “find our life” so to speak - but it will not last. As we grow, hopefully in maturity and wisdom, we come to understand that we are part of something bigger than we think we are. It is only as we being to “lose our life”, the prejudices and the limited thinking, the untruths that have imprisoned us, the focus on ‘my rights’ and the many other ways that we have failed to see the bigger picture that we truly find life. It is an exciting and emancipating journey that has true hospitality at its core.  

I use the term ‘true hospitality’ because like so many other religious terms, the world has taken the word ‘hospitality’ and sanitised it. Now we have a ‘hospitality industry’ and courses about hospitality that in effect take this historically spiritual action and uses it for economic benefit.
When we practice hospitality without its spiritual origins – origins that calls us out of ourselves - we are simply perpetuating a broken world that leaves us all the worse off. True hospitality on the other hand is first and foremost a response that comes from the heart. It is an acknowledgement of who we are meant to be as we strive to encounter the hidden presence of God in all we meet.  True hospitality invites us to live in a counter cultural way, to rediscover the message that Jesus lived and taught. Let us pray for the courage to open ourselves to such possibilities as we strive to create a world that puts the common good ahead of our selfish needs.

Me: Why?

God: Because you are not a puzzle.

Me: What about all of the pieces of my life that are falling down onto the ground?

God: Let them stay there for a while. They fell off for a reason. Take some time and decide if you need any of those pieces back.

Me: You don't understand! I'm breaking down!

God: No. YOU don't understand. YOU ARE BREAKING THROUGH. What you are feeling are just growing pains. You are shedding the things and the people in your life that are holding you back. You are not falling apart. You are falling into place. Relax. Take some deep breaths and allow those things you don't need anymore to fall off of you. Quit holding onto the pieces that don't fit you anymore. Let them fall off. Let them go.

Me: But if I start doing that, what will be left of me?

God: Only the very best pieces of you.

Me: I'm scared of changing.

God: I keep telling you... YOU ARE NOT CHANGING! YOU ARE BECOMING!

Me: Becoming who?

God: Becoming who I created you to be! A person of LIGHT and LOVE and CHARITY and HOPE and COURAGE and JOY and MERCY and GRACE and COMPASSION. I made you for more than the shallow pieces you have decided to adorn yourself with, that you cling to with such greed and fear. Let those things fall off of you. I love you! Do not change! ... Become! Become! Become who I made you to be. I am going to keep telling you this until you remember it.

Me: There goes another piece!

God: That's ok. Let it go.

Me: So... I'm not broken?

God: Of course not! But you are breaking like the dawn. It is a new day. Become!

A visiting pastor attended a men's breakfast in the middle of a rural farming area of the country. The group had asked an older farmer, decked out in his bib overalls, to say grace for the morning breakfast. 
"Lord, I hate buttermilk ", the farmer began. The visiting pastor opened one eye to glance at the farmer, and wondered where this was going. 
The farmer loudly proclaimed "Lord,  I hate lard". Now the pastor was growing concerned. 
Without missing a beat,the farmer continued,  "and Lord, I know that I don't care much for raw white flour ". The pastor once again opened his eye to glance around the room and saw that he wasn't the only one feeling uncomfortable. 
Then the farmer added "But Lord, when you mix them all together and bake them, I do love warm, fresh biscuits. So Lord, when things come up that we don't like, when life gets hard, when we don't understand what you're saying to us, help us to just relax and wait until you are done mixing. It will probably be even better than biscuits. Amen".

A few years ago, during a trip to New York, I took time to visit the beautiful St. Patrick’s Cathedral in the heart of Manhattan. Like so many catholic churches, as soon as you step through the door the first thing you notice is the quiet, restful atmosphere that permeates the place. The vibrancy of its windows and the beauty of its architecture and sacred art creates an ambience of reverence and prayer. Somehow that sacred place reminds you that you are not alone in the world; that you are part of something greater than yourself and that you don’t have to walk the path of life on your own.

When you leave the church, as you pass through the main door, you will find a huge sculpture, 14 meters high, across the street from the cathedral. It is a statue of the titan Atlas, a Greek god, with his arms spread wide as he carries the universe, in the shape of a globe, on his shoulders. In a way the statue offers another view of the world, one where you have to carry the burdens of life on your own; the deadlines, the social pressures, the family heartaches, the illnesses, the broken relationships, the personal failures, the anxieties and worries of life, all the burdens, the pressures and stressors that everyone has to deal with in life.

Today’s gospel reminds us that we don’t have to do it alone. Jesus says “_Come to me, all you who labour and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden light.”_ (Matthew 11:25-30). Jesus’s invitation offers an alternative understanding of how God is present in our life, not as someone who weighs us down with rules and regulations, but as a God of merciful compassion who is to be found in the intricacies of our human existence. In a way that is what our faith is about. It is not some balm or pious platitude that is meant to sooth our pain, but is the inexplicable conviction that comes from our experiences of seeing the hand of God at work in every aspect of our lives.

Of course, in the text above, Jesus wasn’t speaking directly to our modern-day burdens. He was referring specifically to all the regulations that the Pharisees had set out for the Jewish people to follow. In their interpretation of the Torah (the Jewish law), they had made human life even more burdensome: '_They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of others; but they themselves are unwilling to lift a finger to move them' _(Matthew 23:4).The law had expanded to something like 600 rules and regulations that must have felt like the weight of the world to most ordinary people, so Jesus offered another way. 

We hear later in Matthew’s gospel, that in order to be in right relationship with God and the world around us, that we don’t need hundreds of regulations, but only two commandments – love God and love our neighbour. That sounds simple enough – but in reality it is not that easy, because when we truly love God, when we draw close to the heart of God, when we come to know and understand what love really is, rather than the shadows of love that we are often content to live with, everything in our life changes. Once we have experienced love, and choose to live from a place of love, it is no longer possible to hate, to denigrate, to think only of ourselves, to accumulate with no regard for the needs of others, to exploit the vulnerable and the powerless, to take advantage of our power and position, or to act in any of the innumerable other ways in which we promote self over others. What a different world it would be if we were willing to give true love a chance, if we were open enough to look at a given situation from a different angle, if we looked for what we might be missing, rather than blindly insisting that ours is the only way.

When we finally learn to truly love, we gain a greater perspective on life. We become more tolerant and appreciative of the complexities of life and are in a better position to help one another rather than take advantage of a weakness for our own gain.

Jesus seems a to be very aware of our propensity for self-exaltation and so invites us to join him, to ‘yoke up’ with him so to speak, so that we can be constant companions as we traverse the path of life. A yoke is a wooden beam that is normally used between a pair of oxen or other animals to enable them to work together when pulling a heavy load. Once yoked together, both animals are faced in the same direction, they share the load between them, and they achieve more as a pair than as individuals. Jesus uses this agricultural image to help us understand that when we choose the path of true love, we won’t have to do it alone. Side by side with Jesus we are to walk, watching and doing what he does. Side by side with Jesus we are to learn what it means to be fully human, as we learn the way of love. Side by side with Jesus we learn to trust in the providence of God as we slowly let go of the false promises that have held us captive for so long.

As we grow in our relationship with God, we become aware that we are called not only to find peace, refreshment and rest for ourselves, but also to live the kind of life through which others, too, may find God’s peace, God’s refreshing grace, and the joy of placing their lives in God’s hands.
While we live in a world that is changing daily and that is often a scary place, we must remember that God has placed each one of us here in this moment of time and history for his purpose. We are his sons and daughters, disciples of Jesus, potential carriers of the love virus. Let our lives not be a-symptomatic, but beacons of hope for a world that has lost its way. May the God of love strengthen and guides us all.

Eternal Father, You made the whole World stop spinning for a while.
You silenced the noise that we all have created.
You made us bend our knees again and ask for a Miracle. 
You closed Your Churches so we will realize how dark our World is without You in it. 
You humbled the proud and powerful. 
The economy is crashing, businesses are closing. 
We were very proud, we thought that everything we have, everything we possess, was the result of our hard work. 
We have forgotten that it was always Your grace and mercy that made us who we are. 
We’re running in circles looking for some cure to this disease, when in fact we need to humble ourselves and ask You for guidance and wisdom. 
We’ve been living our lives like we will be here on Earth forever, like there’s no Heaven.
Maybe these trials are Your mercy in disguise. 
Maybe this virus is actually Your way of purifying us, & cleansing our souls, bringing us back to YOU.
Today as these words travel the internet, may all who see them join their hearts and hands together in prayer! Asking for forgiveness & asking for healing & protection from this virus...
GOD just wipe it from the Earth!
Father You have been patiently waiting for us. We’re sorry for ignoring Your voice.. and in our selfish ways, we've sometimes forgotten that YOU are GOD!😔
You only need to say the word and our souls shall all be healed. 
We ask these things in Jesus name! ...
Amen

Today’s scripture text (Matthew 13:1-23) is the beginning of one of five lengthy sermons that we find in Matthew’s Gospel. The sermon consists almost entirely of parables and focuses on _The Kingdom of Heaven_, a key theme in Jesus’ teaching. He begins with the parable of the sower, a story that has much to teach us not only about gardening and growing, but more importantly about who God is and how we can cooperate with God’s word. That is not always easy. We live in a world where marketing companies spend billions of Rands hoping to shape our thinking with all kinds of promises concerning our happiness, wellbeing and health. The reality is that, for the most part, they are not interested in making the world a better place, but in accumulating wealth and power for their clients. They are the original _fake news_ experts that mastered the art of spin and half-truths, used globally today, to sway public opinion for political and financial gain. Is it any wonder that people are cautious about what they can believe, reluctant to accept a ‘new truth’ or slow to change a long held outlook on life.

When Jesus began to preach about the _Kingdom of Heaven_, a revolutionary message that reveals God’s desire, God’s plan, God’s vision, God’s love for the world, he encountered a similar reluctance and resistance to change. He was one of many preachers and would have had to establish his credentials, so to speak, through his preaching and his ministry before he was taken seriously. Clearly he did this because in time the religious leaders of the day began to take notice and started to look for ways to undermine him. Part of the controversy of his preaching had to do with the fact that Jesus cast off many of the conditions and restraints that religious leaders had insisted upon as necessary for a person to be considered worthy of God’s Love. The crowds must have wondered about this new teaching, so Jesus told them the parable of the sower.

A parable is a simple story that is told to illustrate a moral or spiritual lesson. It often involves taking an ordinary event from life or nature and using it to explain a more abstract idea, in this case the concept of the _Kingdom of Heaven_. Using the parable of the sower, Jesus assured his listeners that the “Good News” he preached would indeed produce its intended effect, in spite of opposition and controversy.

When Jesus tells the parable of the sower it is clear that the sower represents God. Unlike a farmer who might be careful about where he scattered the seed, when the sower in the parable goes out to sow, he scatters the seed everywhere. His actions represent the radical generosity and boundless love of God. The sower doesn’t discriminate or pick and choose, but rather scatters the seed with abandon. He knows that some of the seed will find rich soil and there produce an abundant crop, but he doesn’t exclude the potential of the ground that is not yet rich – at the very least the birds will have something to eat. So, for Jesus, as he begins to introduce the theme of the kingdom of heaven, one of the first things he wants to make clear is that God is ‘bigger’ than we can imagine, his love and mercy are boundless, and no one is excluded from his embrace. The parables that follow over the next few weeks will help us grow in our understanding of the kingdom and of God’s desire for us.

Jesus’ audience couldn’t miss the point that Jesus was making. Confronted with the extravagant generosity of God’s love and the realisation that their lives, though not perfect, were welcomed in the Kingdom, must have left them asking themselves if they were willing to take a chance on such a teaching. Was it worth clearing away some of the weeds and rocks in their lives in order to respond more fully to the life that Jesus was calling them? The same question is set before us. Are we ready to receive what the sower has to offer?

The invitation to live as Kingdom People - in other words as people who choose to live according to God’s plan, God’s desire for our lives - doesn’t always find the rich soil or the best conditions within us right away. At different times on our journey our inner terrain can be unwelcoming, crowded with the rocks of hurt or sin, plagued with the thorns and distractions of conflicting messages or overwhelmed with the busy-ness of work and family. But the invitation remains. Within us lies the rich soil that awaits that moment of awakening, when we see more clearly God’s plan for our lives. God’s generous love is constant. The gift of God’s word is constant, the seed that promises new life remains unchanged. It is for us to open our hearts, to trust that the new life that God offers is everything that we desire.

Craig Lounsbrough is an author and motivational speaker. He makes the observation that when you see a dandelion as a weed, you’ll spray it, but if you see it as a flower, you’ll draw it close, turn it this way and that, and become lost in the colossal burst of golden petals that pours sunshine into the darkest of souls. He then goes on to ask the question “And so, how many things have we sprayed that could have illuminated our souls if we would have let them be more than what we let them be?” 

That is a great question. How much of life have we missed out on, just because we have rushed to judgement - judgements that we have made about others or maybe judgements that we have made about ourselves. How many people have we dismissed because they belong to one group or another that we have decided are not worthy of our time? How quick we can be to judge, to dismiss someone because we don’t like the look of them, or the size of them, or the colour of them, or the way they talk, or some other characteristic that evokes an often unconscious reaction within us, that we let rule our lives.  

It is easy to like people who are like us – people who share our interests, our values, our way of looking at life, people who are good – like us. But that’s not enough. A key aspect of the Christian story has to do with unity, with overcoming divisions, with the call to live in harmony with each other – that includes people who are different to us. The great commandment simply says “Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. And Love your neighbour as yourself” (Matthew 22: 37-39). That’s no easy ask and it certainly doesn’t happen overnight. But Jesus seems to be saying that that’s okay too.

All the parables in today’s gospel are meant to give us some insight into what the Kingdom of God is like and offer us a picture of how God gradually transforms us from within.  He allows good and evil to coexist and waits patiently for the mysterious growth that occurs when we cooperate with his plan. Just as the farmer cooperates with the sun and rain to make something grow, so too we need to cooperate with God in growing the Kingdom of God within ourselves from the tiny seed received in baptism to the incredible people we can become. Becoming our best selves takes time and patience and requires us to cultivate what is best within us while looking for what is best in the other.

Change and transformation gradually happen as we discern who we are meant to be and what we are called to do with our lives. God waits patiently for this to happen for God has given us the gift of our freedom and allows us to stray as well as to grow true.  When we find ourselves at the lowest ebb in our life it may help us to remember that God’s patience is greater than we can imagine.

Time and again the scriptures show this to be true. Jesus sided with the underdog, with the ones who were struggling and were considered sinful rather than the ones who seemed to have it all together. Think of stories like the woman who was taken in adultery, or the prodigal son, or the lost sheep. Or Zacchaeus, the tax collector whom Jesus invited down from the tree so that he could dine with him that night – not when he had converted and turned his life around – but that very night. Even when he was nailed to the cross Jesus cried out, “Father forgive them, for they know not what they do” (Luke 23:24).

Today’s readings are an invitation to a new way of life. They invite us to reflect on how we live and remind us of the power we have to transform the world around us. If the coronavirus has taught us anything it has helped us to see how interconnected our lives are. We used to think that we caught diseases individually, but that is not the whole truth. We catch diseases as individuals who are part of families, and families who are parts of cities, and cities that are parts of countries and countries that are part of the world. We have learned the hard lesson, through the spread of a simple virus, that our whole planet can be changed because of how we interact.

The good news of course is that just as our interconnectedness can spread disease, it also means that we have the power to do good. Like the mustard seed that grows into the great tree, or the yeast that causes the batch of dough to rise, each one of us carry within us the power we need to transform our world. When we take time to see others for who they truly are, and give them the space to be all that they might be, we are doing something truly beautiful and courageous. Our actions help to bring about the world that Jesus talks about, the kingdom of God here and now. We do that of course when we love rather than when we judge. As Thomas Merton once wrote “Our job is to love others without stopping to inquire whether or not they are worthy. That is not our business and, in fact, it is nobody's business. What we are asked to do is to love, and this love itself will render both ourselves and our neighbours worthy.”

2020/07/24, 15:28 - +27 82 851 5315: *Discovering God through His Attributes  - If we know God better, we are able to worship Him in a deeper manner_*** :

" By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, their starry host by the breath of His mouth" Psalm 33vs6

 **God is Omnipotent - He is all powerful* 

God is not just all powerful, but their is no limit to his power. In Ephesians Paul says that God is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine. (Eph 3vs20)

For the believer this brings us great comfort and assurance, because when we are faced with a  situation that appears beyond what we can handle,, or life itself becomes so complicated and confusing that we have no idea what a solution could be, we can have the confidence to go to God because with him nothing is impossible.

The challenge for us is , do we believe that? A test to evaluate whether we truly believe this or not will be seen in how much we are prepared to really trust Him, or how often we try and find solutions in our own strength often to no avail.

Next time you look at a tree, or mountain remember God spoke that into existence! How much more then cant He intervene in the relatively by comparison "small" things that cause us anxiety and stress. - we just have to ask Him for help.

Have a blessed day🙂

In west Texas, there is a famous oil field known as Yates Oil Field. It is a massive oil field that has produced more than one billion barrels of oil, making it one of the largest oil fields in the United States. During the great depression this field was a sheep ranch owned by Ira and Ann Yates. Ira was not able to make enough money on the ranch to pay his mortgage, so much so that he was in danger of losing his land. In fact, his family was so poor that they, like many others, had to live on a government support subsidy just to keep food on the table. One day Ira heard about an oil excavation company called Transcontinental Oil who were testing for oil in the area. He decided to invite them on to his property to do some exploration work. He signed a lease with the company allowing them to sink a test well. At a little more than a thousand feet they struck a huge oil reserve giving eighty thousand barrels a day. In fact, thirty years after the discovery, a government test of one of the wells showed that it could still produce more than a hundred thousand barrels of oil a day. And the Yates’ owned it all. The day he had purchased the land, Ira had also received the oil and mineral rights. And yet, he had been living on a government subsidy – a multimillionaire living in poverty. Imagine, he was literally sitting on a gold mine and he didn’t know that it was there. He owned it, but he didn’t know the value of what he possessed.

In today’s Gospel Jesus is instructing his disciples and us about the Kingdom of Heaven. When Matthew talks about the Kingdom of Heaven, he is not talking about life after death, about some future reality. What he calls the Kingdom of Heaven is called the Kingdom of God in the gospels of Mark and Luke. In the Jewish tradition the name of God is never spoken. But Matthew takes that one step further. He refrains from even mentioning the word God substituting instead the word heaven, which is the dwelling place of God. A helpful way of understanding what the Kingdom of God means is to look at the prayer that Jesus taught us - the Our Father. A common teaching technique in Jewish literature is to express an idea in one line, then to express the same idea in the following line but using different words or images. So for example, in the Lord’s prayer we say “thy Kingdom come”. In the line following we express the same idea but in different words, “they will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” As such the evangelists understood that the Kingdom of God was about fulfilling God’s will, God’s desire, God’s plan for the world. They understood that the Kingdom isn’t some kind of earthly construct meant to replace the political structures of the day but is more to do with us discovering who we are really meant to be and recognising that God has created us for so much more than we can possibly imagine. In Luke’s Gospel Jesus makes this clear when he declares ‘The kingdom of God is within you’ (Luke 17:21). The treasure is within. It is there in our life somewhere. It only has to be discovered.

In the parables we just heard in our gospel today (Matthew 13:44-52), Jesus describes different aspects of the Kingdom. Using the imagery of a man finding a treasure and a merchant finding a pearl of great price He alerts us to the reality that discovering God’s plan isn’t something that comes easily. We have to search, to explore, to examine what is happening in our life with an eye to finding the treasure within. When we begin to look at the experiences of our life in this way then our existence takes on a whole new meaning and purpose. Every aspect of it, the good and the bad, has something to offer. Our lives are like the net in the last parable today. The net collects fish of every kind. When it is full, they haul it ashore and sit down to put what is good into buckets. What is bad they throw away. So too with us, we have to search within. There somewhere, amongst the good and the bad, the joys and heartaches, the successes and failures, the tears and laughter we will find the treasure. And it’s not always found in the joys or successes or in the laughter. Sometimes the pearl of great price is forged in the gritty places in our life and only later reveals its value.  

We will recognise the kingdom when we find it. It is to be found in the peace amidst our storms, for God is in the silence; it is in the ability to forgive and let go, for God is mercy and compassion; it is in the desire to help a brother or sister, for God is love; it is in the impulse to welcome the stranger, for God is relationship; it is a sense of detachment, for God is freedom.

When we say yes to life; when we trust who we are and stand firm regarding our values; when we make the decisions to love even when it is hard to love; when we recognise that it is not possible to go it alone and that we need each other; when we allow our sense of wonder to open our minds to new possibilities, then we are experiencing the Kingdom of God. These are the moments which Jesus calls us to treasure. Let us be ever alert for their presence in our life and let us celebrate them with great reverence. Then, we might be surprised at the abundance of life that has been given us.

The miracle we hear about in today’s gospel (Matthew 14:13-21) is one of the more unusual and important stories that we read in the scriptures. It is the only miracle story that appears in all four gospels, thus stressing its importance for the early Christian community, and for us. The love and generosity of Jesus in tending to the needs of the hungry crowd offers us an insight into his own total self-giving - something that we will see again at the last supper when Jesus takes the bread, blesses it, breaks it and gives it to us as a way of sharing in his life for all time.

Jesus demonstrates God’s caring love for us by feeding the people, spiritually by his preaching and physically by the miraculous multiplication of five loaves and two fish. In feeding the five thousand, Matthew the evangelist wants us to make the clear connection between Jesus and God. Just as God fed the Israelites with Manna in the desert so Jesus miraculously feeds this enormous crowd with five loves and two fish. Only God could do something as extraordinary as this. Matthew wants us to understand that Jesus is indeed the expected messiah and that he shares in the divine nature of God who loves us without reserve and promises to be with us until the end of time. Paul emphasises this point in his letter to the Romans (8;35-39) when he writes ‘I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor present things, nor future things, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God made visible in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

In the gospel story it is clear that the crowds that followed Jesus came for more than just physical food. In fact, it is the disciples who bring up the subject of food at the end of the day when they went to Jesus and suggested that he should send the people away. Instead the story relates that the crowds had brought their sick whom Jesus healed because his heart was moved with pity for them.

The pity that moved Jesus to action is contrasted with the concern of the disciples who come to Jesus and asks that he sends the people away so that they can get something to eat. Interestingly Jesus doesn’t do that, instead he says “give them some food yourselves.” It is an invitation to share in his ministry. The disciples seem somewhat astonished at this suggestion and declare that they only have five loaves and two fish – how does he expect them to help with the little that they had.

Perhaps we can identify with the disciples when it comes to our own response to the challenges of our world today. We are surrounded by poverty and hunger, especially in these difficult times of the Covid pandemic, and are at times overwhelmed with the countless injustices of an increasingly polarised society that we too can often wonder “what can I do”? Like the disciples we might wish people well but feel unable to help because the problem seems so big and our ‘five loaves and two fish’ would only be like a drop in the ocean.

Jesus’ response to the disciples and to us is key. He says to them “Bring them here to me.” In other words, bring the little you have. You don’t have to do this alone. When he takes the five loaves and the two fish, he looks up to heaven, says a blessing, breaks the loaves and gives them to the disciples who in turn give them to the crowds. This is significant because here we see Jesus practicing what he preached. We see his total reliance on his father as he responded to a crisis. The evangelist wants us to understand that when we are faced with a crisis, regardless of the enormity of the situation or the limitation of our resources, that our proper response is to turn to Jesus and to rely on his help. When we start putting our care and compassion into positive action, the little we are able to do is multiplied by God’s grace in such a way that it becomes more than sufficient for the need.

Mother Teresa seemed to understand this when she said “I used to pray that God would feed the hungry, or do this or that, but now I pray that he will guide me to do whatever I'm supposed to do, what I can do. I used to pray for answers, but now I'm praying for strength. I used to believe that prayer changes things, but now I know that prayer changes us and we change things.”

What first happened on a hill in Galilee continues today every time we gather for Eucharist, but just as importantly it happens whenever we offer our five loaves and two fish to help satisfy the physical and spiritual hunger of someone else who is in need. Our own five loaves and two fish, our own small stumbling efforts to go beyond ourselves, to share with others from the little we have can have a much greater effect than we can imagine. Those efforts are truly blessed and give life to others, while mysteriously bringing satisfaction and enrichment to our own lives too. Our faith is not just about saying prayers or practicing some spiritual ritual. It is above all a call to action, to bring to fulfilment God’s plan for the world as we share in the life and ministry of Jesus. We may never see the results of our actions, but that doesn’t matter, all that matters is that we put our faith and trust in God, the rest is in God’s hands.

It is above all a call to action, to bring to fulfilment God’s plan for the world as we share in the life and ministry of Jesus. We may never see the results of our actions, but that doesn’t matter, all that matters is that we put our faith and trust in God, the rest is in God’s hands.

Alexander Solzhenitsyn is a famous Russian author, historian and short story writer. He was highly critical of Joseph Stalin, the dictator leader of the Soviet Union, and of communism, and ended up in an infamous slave labour camp as a result. It was in fact Solzhenitsyn’s writings about the slave-labour camp system that raised global awareness about the atrocities that were happening there.

Solzhenitsyn admitted that once during his long imprisonment that he became so discouraged that he no longer cared whether he lived or died. He had been outdoors on a work detail and considered taking his own life. When a break was called he sat down, and a stranger came and sat beside him, someone he had never seen before and would never see again. For no apparent reason, this stranger took a stick and drew a cross on the ground. Solzhenitsyn sat and stared at the cross for a long while. He later wrote, “Staring at that cross, I realized that therein lies freedom.”

At that point, in the midst of a storm of inner darkness and despair, Solzhenitsyn received new courage and the will to live. Somehow in that moment of reflection he was able to step through the chaos around him to a place of stillness that allowed him to find a new perspective. He came to realise that he was not alone, and that even though he was physically imprisoned, he had an inner freedom that no one could take away. The storm didn’t end that day, and indeed there were more storms to come, but through his faith in Jesus, Solzhenitsyn found the strength to ride each one out. He went on to live to the age of 89 inspiring millions of people through his writings and his willingness to speak critically of political systems and leaders that abused their power.

Just like Solzhenitsyn, all of us experience storms in our life from time to time. They are an inevitable part of our human existence. Sometimes we can get so caught in the turmoil of our situation that we lose direction and begin to despair. In our first reading today (I Kg 19:9. 11-13) Elijah finds himself in that situation. He is on the run having evoked the anger of Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab. Elijah was a prophet who had just demonstrated the power of Yahweh, the God of Israel, when he challenged the gods of Baal (favoured by Jezebel) to a dual on Mt Carmel. When the gods of Baal are defeated and slaughtered, Jezebel sends Elijah a menacing message indicating her intention to have him slaughtered just as he has slaughtered her prophets: “_Thus and more may the gods do if by this time tomorrow I have not made you like one of them_” (1 Kings 19:2). So frightened is Elijah by Jezebel’s threat that he flees into the desert and takes refuge in a cave, near Mt. Horeb. Despite having witnessed the triumph of Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mt Carmel, Elijah seems to falter in his faith that the Almighty will protect him. He gives in to despair and becomes so miserable that he asks God to let him die. When he is in the cave however, he experienced the presence of the Lord who asks him to go outside to ‘stand before the Lord .. who will be passing by.’ Trusting in the Lord Elijah goes outside where he experiences heavy winds, an earthquake and even a fire, but God is not in any of them. Then he experiences ‘a tiny whispering sound’ which he recognises as the presence of God and is strengthened once again to continue his mission as a prophet.

There is a very significant lesson for us in Elijah’s story. God spoke to Elijah not in the storm or the earthquake or the fire, but in a tiny whisper. How often do we seek God with distracted minds, when we are caught up in the turmoil of our situation. God is there in the turmoil alright, in the storms and in the chaos, but we are so agitated or flustered that we miss the signs. It is only when we take a moment to recollect ourselves, to still our mind and heart, that we can find the peace that God offers even in the heart of the storm.

Keeping our focus on God is reinforced in our Gospel reading when the disciples find themselves in a storm on the sea of Galilee. Naturally they are frightened as their boat is tossed around on the waves but they become terrified when they see what appears to be a ghost approaching them from across the water. They cry out in fear. But the ghost turns out to be Jesus, who reveals himself to them, saying: ‘_Courage! It is I! Do not be afraid’_. Peter, encouraged by Jesus’ words is the first to respond. At Jesus’ invitation, he goes to him across the water, but when he ‘_feels the force of the wind_’ his courage fails him and he begins to sink. Then, Jesus reaches out his hand to him and saves him.

Like the story of Elijah, this story draws our attention to the fact that it was only when Peter took his eyes off the Lord, ‘_when he feels the force of the wind’,_ when his focus moved to what he had no power over, rather than the power of the Lord, it was then that fear crept in and caused him to sink. Being a follower of Christ doesn’t mean that we will be spared the trials and tribulations of life, but that when they come, we can be sure that we are not alone.

I don’t know what storms you may be enduring at this time, or what the week ahead will bring. But I do know this: even as the storm rages around you, if you listen very carefully with your heart, you will hear a ‘tiny whispering sound’ encouraging you, “_Take heart, it is I; do not be afraid._” Fear becomes courage in prayer, so let your prayer be the place where you step through the challenges of today in to the peace that Jesus promises.
2020/08/09, 07:51 - +27 82 851 5315: WOMAN*. . . . . . . . .

When God created woman he was working late on the 6th day.......

An angel came by and asked." Why spend so much time on her?"

The lord answered. "Have you seen all the specifications I have to meet to shape her?"

●She must function in all kinds of situations. 
●She must be able to embrace several kids at the same time.
●Capable of a hug that can heal anything from a bruised knee to a broken heart.
●She must do all this with only two hands.
●She cures herself when sick and can work 18 hours a day.

THE ANGEL was impressed" With just two hands.....impossible!

And this is the standard model?"

The Angel came closer and touched the woman.
"But you have made her so soft, Lord".
"She is soft", said the Lord,
"But I have made her strong. You can't imagine what she can endure and overcome"

"Can she think?" The Angel asked...
The Lord answered. "Not only can she think, she can reason and negotiate".

The Angel touched her cheeks....
"Lord, it seems this creation is leaking! You have put too many burdens on her".
"She is not leaking...They are tears". The Lord corrected the Angel…

"What's it for?" Asked the Angel..... .
The Lord said. "Tears are her way of expressing her grief, her doubts, her love, her loneliness, her suffering and her pride."...

This made a big impression on the Angel,
"Lord, you are a genius. You thought of everything.
A woman is indeed marvellous"

Lord said ."Indeed she is.
■She has strength that amazes a man.
■She can handle trouble and carry heavy burdens.
■She holds happiness, love and opinions.
■She smiles when she feels like screaming.
■She sings when she feels like crying, cries when happy and laughs when afraid.
■She fights for what she believes in.
■Her love is unconditional.
■Her heart is broken when a next-of-kin or a friend dies but she finds strength to get on with life"

The Angel asked: So she is a perfect being?
The lord replied: No. She has just one drawback.
"She often forgets what she is worth".

Send it to all the women u respect ....👍
And to all men who respect women 👍👍

 For my family,
 For my food,
 For a roof under which we can rest.

 🌾 DO NOT ALLOW, O LORD, that death from this silent disease will lead to the loss of more innocent people.

 🌾 Your Holy Will be done.

 🌾 Bless and protect all doctors, nurses, police officers, members of defence forces, firefighters, and all workers who, by Your sovereign order, go out every day to save lives.

 🌾 Return them healthy and safe to their homes, Lord.

Tim and Margaret were an elderly couple who were married for over 50 years. Late in her life Margaret developed Alzheimer’s and eventually had to move to a nursing home. Every day Tim would visit Margaret and every day Margaret would ask Tim who he was and why he was visiting her. Each time Tim would explain who he was and recount the names of their children and grandchildren and tell Margaret all about the daily activities that were happening in the family, and each time Margaret would smile brightly as if told for the first time.

Tim would sit and help Margaret with her lunch and spend the day talking about this and that. At the end of the day, before he went home, he would give Margaret a kiss and tell her that he loved her, knowing well that tomorrow he will have to repeat the whole routine again. One day one of Tim’s friends, with the good intention of making Tim’s life easier, asked why he put himself through that every day - given that Margaret didn’t even know who he was any more. Tim’s response was “But I know who she is, and I know who I am.”

At the heart of Tim’s answer is a clear understanding of his identity. Identity is the place that we live from - it is the truth of who we are that has been forged over time as we reflect on our interactions with others and come to a peace about our purpose in the world. It has to do with who we are rather than the role we fulfil. Once the role or the degree or the trade or the title is taken away, we still exist. By its nature our identity is more malleable, more easily swayed, in our younger years as we search for the truth about ourselves and everything that surrounds us. As we grow in wisdom and understanding; as we learn from the mistakes we have made and gain insight from our interactions with others, and as we come to identify the values that we choose to embrace in life, we become more sure of ourselves and are less likely to be influenced by others. Just as our actions and interactions help to form our identity, our identity in turn shapes our actions and reveals to others who we really are.

Knowing who we are and knowing our purpose in life is a key theme in the exchange that takes place between Jesus and his disciples in today’s Gospel. (Matthew 16:13-20). Jesus raises the question of identity when he asks his disciples “Who do people say that I am?” It is a question that is on everybody’s lips: Who is this man Jesus? The disciples are quick to share some of the extraordinary speculation that surrounds their friend. Some say that he is John the Baptist, others Elijah, still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. What is striking is that people have identified something special about Jesus. Clearly his life and actions have made an impact. He is someone to be admired. But then Jesus asks the probing question “Who do you say that I am?” That question leaves no room for speculation but requires a personal response. Peter immediately declares "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” Peter had come to know that Jesus was the Christ, because he had seen the way Jesus lived. He had seen the choices he had made, how he was present to others and how he acted when he was with people. He had seen that Jesus wasn’t so much concerned about himself but on his mission to make known God’s invitation to the world. He had a purpose and he wasn’t afraid to follow his heart.
So, what might this gospel be saying to us today? One of the things that strikes me is that we live in a world that promotes self-obsession. Everything is about ‘me.’ My choice. My Freedom. My Life. We are encouraged to be the best, to look the most beautiful, to be the fittest, to achieve the most. We are ‘trained’ to accumulate and to hoard with little or no regard for the impact of our actions on others. The implicit promise of this self-focussed life is happiness, fulfilment and contentment. The reality of course is that such a course of action more often than not leads to sadness and despair, not because those things are bad in themselves, but because we try to use things that are outside of ourselves to fulfil a longing that we can only find the answer to within.
The life of Jesus reminds us that ‘the fullness of life’ has to do with knowing who we are and discovering our purpose in life. No more than we can ‘find’ happiness or hope, or any other virtue for that matter in some self-obsessed quest - they come when we are busy with other things - so the gift of peace and contentment, the gift of a full life, comes when we are looking beyond our ‘self.’
At our baptism, and every time we profess our faith, we acknowledge that we have come to recognise the importance of having Christ in our life. Like Peter, we may be able to say that Jesus is the Christ, the son of the living God. How we live our faith, however, how we show God’s presence to others, how we bring healing to what is fractured and hope where there is despair, reveals what Jesus truly means to us. It is the telling factor in whether we have allowed Jesus to shape who we are and consequently how we live.
So today, as we profess our faith, let us give thanks for the grace that comes with faith and pray for the courage to be who we are meant to be, to follow your heart and our intuition – for they somehow already know who we can become.

In 1946 Mother Teresa began her ministry to India’s poor. Following an experience where she had a deep sense of being called to "serve the poorest of the poor" she requested permission to leave the convent to work in the slums of Calcutta. She said that leaving her family to become a missionary was very difficult but leaving the convent was even more difficult because she loved the work she was doing and it was there that she learned how to serve others. The work of Mother Teresa is well known. What is perhaps less well known is the fact that she continued her ministry for more than fifty years in a state of spiritual darkness. A few years after her death excerpts from her letters and journals were published. They revealed something of her inner turmoil which at times even left her questioning the very existence of God. And yet, despite the bleakness, despite feeling that God had forgotten her, like Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, she kept going, driven by a deep conviction that she was doing what she was meant to be doing.

There is no doubt that the choices Mother Teresa made to help the poor brought suffering and challenges to her life, but they also unleashed a force for good that changed the lives of so many people, not only those whom she helped, but the thousands of women who gave up their comfortable lives to join in the work she began. As she ministered in the streets and gutters of Calcutta, as she reached out to lepers, orphans, widows and beggars she brought hope and dignity to people who had been cast aside and forgotten, while at the same time raising social awareness about the political and cultural choices that creates such poverty in the first place. At one level the achievements of Mother Teresa seem extraordinary and they appear to come at a great personal cost, but what if she was only doing what she was meant to do with her life? What if she simply discovered deep within herself her true potential and lived from that place? Could it be that in doing so she achieved so much more with her life, and discovered a sense of purpose that greatly outweighed the struggles she experienced?

In today’s gospel (Matthew 16:21-27) we encounter Jesus preparing his disciples for what he intuitively knows lies ahead. His mission on earth has been one that has questioned the way things are and challenged the societal structures that have allowed people to be exploited, abused and discriminated against. He has spoken truth to power and knows that there will be a push back, but nevertheless is prepared to press on, regardless of the consequences.  Peter takes him aside to try and convince him to find an easier way. But Jesus denounces him, even calling him Satan – a clear reference to the temptation in the desert when Satan tries to lure Jesus away from his mission to bring salvation to the world. Jesus remains true to himself and in so doing breaks the shackles of sin and death, winning for all of us the promise of new life.

Having rebuked Peter, Jesus turns to the crowd and makes know the demands of the gospel. He declares “Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.” At first reading, Jesus’ words to “deny self” seem unreasonable. What is the purpose of our lives if we have to deny who we are? When we include the clarification that follows however, “whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” they make more sense. It occurs to me that Jesus is challenging us to find our true purpose in life, and not to settle for a half lived existence. What if the invitation of Jesus to “Follow Me” is not so much to live the life that he lived, but to fully live the life that we are meant to live, to follow his example in the way he stayed true to his God given mission. What better way is there to give glory to God than to be the person God created me to be, reflecting in my life the life of God, the one in whose image I am made.

When Jesus asks us to ‘deny self’ he is not asking us to punish ourselves, but to liberate ourselves from the smallness that so often keeps us captive and from the limited thinking that prevents us from seeing the truth that is before us. Saint Paul gives similar advice in today’s second reading (Romans 12:1-2) when he writes: “Do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and pleasing and perfect.”

Taking up our cross simply means accepting the fact that when we liberate our minds, when we become conscious of the injustices that surround us, and when we begin to live differently, there will be challenges, but when we dig deeper to the true self, how much more rewarding our lives will be. It is then that we unleash our true potential and begin to live as people of God. God asks no more than that. As Irenaeus reminds us “the glory of God is man fully alive.”

Jerome Weidman, the author of the book “Hand of the Hunter” tells the story of a life changing incident that happened when he was a third grader in school. One day his maths teacher, Mrs O’Neill, decided to give her class a test. When she was grading the papers, she noticed that 12 boys had given the same unusual wrong answer to the same question. The next day she asked the 12 boys to remain behind after class finished. Then, without accusing any of them, she wrote 21 words on the board. They read: “The measure of a man’s real character is what he would do if he knew he would never be found out.” Then she wrote the name of the man who said them: Thomas Babington Macaulay. Later Weidman would write: “I don’t know about the other 11 boys. Speaking for the only one of the dozen with whom I am on intimate terms, I can say this: it was the single most important lesson of my life.”

Mrs O’Neill could have handled the case of the cheating boys in a number of different ways. She could have frog-marched them all to the principal’s office and reported their crime to him. She could have shouted at then in the class and humiliated them in front of their friends or she could have called their parents and made a big deal of the fact that they were caught cheating. But she didn’t do any of those things. Instead she taught them a lesson that they would never forget. Her method of correction was not one of humiliation and denigration, but one that appealed to their best selves. She offered them an opportunity to glimpse what it might be like to be a person of character, a person of integrity, a person of honour, and in doing so she helped them learn from their mistake without having to carry the scars and embarrassment of their shame throughout their life.

Mrs O’Neill was a wise woman. She recognised the need to correct the boys, but more importantly, she understood that there is a right way and a wrong way to correct someone. We see this reality play out in our scriptures today (Matthew 18:15-20). Jesus recognised that the people who were making the decision to follow him, to become his disciples, were not perfect people, but men and women that would inevitably make mistakes. He knew that conflicts would arise and that relationships would become strained, because that’s just how life is. Sometimes it is us that messes up and sometimes it’s someone else, a family member or friend, a work colleague or church member. The question is how should we treat someone when things go wrong? How we would like to be treated ourselves when we are wrong?

It is clear from the Gospels that respect, compassion, mercy, forgiveness and love are the hallmarks of the Christian life. Allowing these values to shape our lives helps to create harmony and bring an end to division and destruction. So when Jesus deals with the subject of conflict the first thing he recommends is to look for ways to heal the relationship. Begin by reaching out to the other person - one on one - to see how a misunderstanding can be resolved. If that doesn’t work, “take one or two others along with you, so that ‘every fact may be established.” In other words don’t give up on the relationship, don’t throw in the towel, ask one or two others to help you “hear” what you might be missing. Much of our conflict has to do with the reality that we keep missing each other, we fail to grasp the other’s perspective. If that doesn’t work, “tell the church and if that doesn’t work treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector.”  Now there is an interesting line. Treat him as you would a Gentile or a tax collector.

In the Jewish mind Gentiles and Tax collectors were considered unclean. They were outsiders who were shunned and dismissed. Could Jesus mean that we should just dismiss someone if our efforts at reconciliation are at first not successful? I don’t think so. Remember that the author of this Gospel, Matthew, is himself a Tax collector. In chapter nine of this gospel, Jesus calls Matthew and has a meal with him “and many [other] tax collectors and sinners” (Matthew 9:9-13). That prompts the pharisees to ask: “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”  Jesus answers: “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy, not sacrifice.’ For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

In this short passage, we find that Jesus accepts and shares a meal with “sinners” (even tax collectors).  This would have transformed Matthew’s whole outlook on life, and in fact we know that it inspired him to give up his old ways in order to embrace the life that Jesus offered. Interestingly, after telling the story of how he became a follower of Jesus, Matthew writes a list of all the disciples. The list includes Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew his brother; etc, but when he comes to his own name he elaborates and says Matthew the tax collector. It is as if Matthew lists his profession in order to make the point that this is the way that Jesus treats tax collectors! He embraces us, he accepts us, he welcomes us, he loves us. No one is excluded. Jesus urges us his followers to live in a similar way. Even when someone is not ready to be reconciled, be ready to accept their choice. Continue to treat them in a respectful way, and love them from a distance if that is what it takes.  Who is in the right and who is in the wrong is not as important as finding a common ground where the relationship can build from. By not judging or condemning the other, but by showing that we place more importance on the person than on the mistake, we begin to reflect the life of Christ and can be sure that our efforts will be rewarded.

Corrie ten Boom lived in Amsterdam during World War II. Her family owned a watchmaker’s shop. When the Nazis occupied the Netherlands her family began to help Jews who were being systematically rounded up and sent to death camps. Eventually someone turned the family in, and they were sent to concentration camps. Corrie and her sister, Betsy, were sent to the infamous Ravensbruck camp. Only Corrie survived the family ordeal. After the war she travelled about Europe, lecturing on forgiveness and reconciliation. One evening, after one of her talks a man came forward to thank her for the talk. Corrie couldn’t believe her eyes. He was one of the Nazi guards who supervised the women’s shower room at Ravensbruck. The man reached out to shake Corrie’s hand, but Corrie froze. She couldn’t take his hand. The horror of the camp and the death of her sister leaped back into her memory. She was filled with resentment and revulsion. She couldn’t believe her response. She had just given a moving talk on forgiveness, and now she herself couldn’t forgive someone. 

Later she recalled that she had not felt the slightest spark of warmth or charity – but knew in her head if not in her heart, that she needed to let go of the bitterness and the hurt. She says that in that moment she breathed a silent prayer, “Jesus, I cannot forgive him.   Give me your forgiveness.” Then as she took his hand she said that a most incredible thing happened. From her shoulder along her arm and through her arm and through her hand a current seemed to pass from her to him, while into her heart sprang a love for this stranger that almost overwhelmed her. For Corrie, it was an incredible moment, a moment when she discovered that the grace of forgiveness rests not with us alone, but is connected to the healing power of God’s love working within us.

Forgiveness isn’t easy, yet it is a very necessary part of our lives. It is often confused with other actions such as forgetting or condoning or ‘being too soft.’ Forgiveness is not the same as forgetting - “Forgive and forget,” we sometimes hear people say. Forgetting about a hurt or simply brushing it off is often used as a way of “keeping the peace.” The reality is that the hurt lies buried within and eventually begins to fester and show up in all kinds of ways, like resentments, bitterness, frustrations or even illness.

Another misconception about forgiveness is the idea that if I forgive someone, I am in some way condoning their bad or abusive behaviour. Forgiveness is not denying that evil is real or that injury has occurred. If a person says, “I can’t forgive because I think what someone did is terribly wrong,” he or she is confusing forgiveness and approval. Forgiveness does not mean overlooking evil or approving it or accepting injustices. Some things are inexcusable and need to be brought to justice, but they can still be forgivable.

At its core, forgiveness is first and foremost a personal act. It is about finding healing for a hurt or an injustice that has been inflicted upon us. Forgiveness pulls the poison spear from the wound that lies within and allows us to heal. It frees us from the negative feelings and emotions that threaten to destroy our lives and helps restore our dignity and self-worth. Forgiveness is about me taking control of my life again and not allowing the actions of someone else determine the course of my life - because that is exactly what happens if we don’t forgive. The hurt soon turns to bitterness and the bitterness to hate and that toxic poison destroys not only ourselves, but seeps in to our relationships and destroys them also.

So when Jesus responds to Peter’s question about forgiveness in our gospel today (Matthew 18:21–35) he make it clear that forgiveness is a necessary part of our daily lives. Peter has asked a reasonable question: What are the limits of forgiveness toward someone who injures me? Peter himself suggests Seven times which shows that he know the importance of forgiveness. Seven is a symbolic number in the Bible and means infinity or perfection. Jesus’ response goes beyond all limitations when he says “Not seven times but 77 times.” In other words, there is no limit to the number of times we might need to forgive.

Going beyond the question itself, Jesus tells the parable of the ‘unforgiving servant.’ In doing so he wants us to reflect on the reality that there is a moment in all of our lives when we have needed forgiveness. It is easy to forget our own sin, our own transgressions, our own misdeeds, when we are busy nurturing a hurt or a grievance. But as people of God we are called to a different way of living, a way of living that reflects the mind of God, a way of living that will allow us to have the best quality of life possible. That can’t happen if our life is full of bitterness and hurt. The only way to be free is to forgive. I want to end with a quote from Lewis Smedes who is an author and theologian. Speaking on forgiveness he famously declared: “To forgive is to set a prisoner free only to discover that the prisoner was you.” Forgiveness does not change the past, but it sure can change the future.

- Often the challenges we go through seem like they could destroy us.

Over the past few months it has been extraordinary to witness how people have been so willing to reach out and help each other during the Covid pandemic. Communities came together in a time of need and helped each other, whether it was raising funds for the less well off, organising meals for the house confined or distributing food parcels to those in need. Help was offered and there was no expectation of reward. 

As I reflected on this reality it occurred to me that humanity is at its best when we are looking out for each other. In moments of crisis we instinctually want to help, to do the right thing, to give a helping hand. The opposite is also true, we are at our worst when we think only of ourselves, when we get preoccupied with what we have or don’t have, when we start comparing ourselves to someone else, or when we start feeling hard done by. In our self-absorbed state we begin to justify our negative feelings and begin to harbour feelings of envy and jealousy that eventually destroy our sense of self-worth and robs us of the gift of gratitude, that essential virtue that helps us to find balance in our life. 

Today’s gospel (Matthew 20:1-16) invites us to explore some of those feelings and to recall a time when we were aggrieved at our lot in life, when we felt hard done by or when we felt that we didn’t get what we deserved, and then it asks us to think again. When Jesus addresses the disciples, he once again draws their attention to the nature of God. He begins, “the kingdom of heaven is like … and goes on to tell the extraordinary story of how a landlord paid all the labourers in his vineyard the same salary for a day’s work, even though some of them worked from early in the morning and others only arrive an hour before the work was finished. 

At first hearing the story seems unfair. Surely those who worked a longer day should have been paid more than those who only worked for an hour or two. But of course, this is not a story about labour law or best work practices, but a story about the nature of God. It is meant to reveal something of God’s plan, God’s desire, God’s will for the world, while helping the hearer to understand his/her place in that plan. 

By the time the story ends, we come to realise that the landowner not only acted justly but he had in fact been exceptionally generous. He gave those who laboured in the field for a full day the amount agreed upon but also gave a full-day's wage to those who only worked for an hour or two. The landlord is aware that the workers who were left without work for most of the day still needed to eat, they still needed to feed their families and provide for their basic needs. If it wasn’t for his generosity they would have gone home hungry to face their starving children. The landlord knew this and while respecting their dignity gave them what they needed – a day’s food.  They didn’t earn their wage in the same way as the workers who toiled for the full day, but they needed it. Jesus wanted his disciples, and us, to know and understand that no one truly earns God’s favour and love, no matter how long we have known the Lord, or worked in his vineyard, it is given freely and generously to all.

Another lesson we might take away from today’s gospel is the danger of assumptions. The first workers assume, wrongly, that since they had worked the full day, they would be paid more than the late comers. I have often wondered why the parable has the landowner pay the latecomers first - if it had been the other way around no one would have been the wiser. Could it be that Jesus wanted to make the point that God’s way of thinking and acting is very different to our way of thinking and acting. How often in our life have we tied ourselves up in knots or harboured disappointments because of flawed thinking and wrong assumptions? 

Flawed thinking opens us up to envy and resentment, two emotions that poison our spirit and leads to unhappiness and despair. Someone once said that “Envy is a symptom of lack of appreciation of our own uniqueness and self-worth. Each of us has something to give that no one else has.” Our gospel today certainly reminds us that in God’s plan, there is a place for each one of us and that taking time to be grateful for who we are and what we have will give each of us a greater appreciation of our own self-worth. 

What a different world it would be if gratitude was part of our everyday lives, if we could stop looking over our shoulder at what everyone else has and instead looked for opportunities to help and support one another without measuring our giving or measuring each other’s worth.  In this gospel Jesus calls us to a new way of living that invites us to live from a place of love, a love which lets go of ego, pride and envy and embraces instead a spirit of generosity and kindness.

Over the years Pope Francis has made some surprising and sometimes humbling statements during his interviews or in his homilies that have caused people to think again about how they understand their faith or what it means to be church. In one interview in 2013 he said “I see clearly that the thing the church needs most today is the ability to heal wounds and to warm the hearts of the faithful; it needs nearness, proximity. I see the church as a field hospital after battle. It is useless to ask a seriously injured person if he has high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugars. You have to heal his wounds. And you have to start from the ground up. This is the mission of the church: the church heals, it cures. . . The mission of the church is to heal wounds of the heart, to open doors, to free people, to say that God is good, God forgives all.” In other words, the church need to be an instrument of healing, right in the midst of the world’s hurts and sorrows, rather than being an institution that stands aloof in judgment of peoples failures.  

In another interview, Fr Antonio Spadaro, S.J asked the Pope” Who is Jorge Mario Bergoglio – the pope’s family name?” Fr Antonio said that pope Francis stared at him in silence, so he asked him if it was okay to ask that question. The pope nodded and replied: “I ​​do not know what might be the most fitting description.... I am a sinner. This is the most accurate definition. It is not a figure of speech, a literary genre. I am a sinner.” I love Francis’ humanity, his ability to recognise that despite his status and rank in the church and in society, he is still a man with the weaknesses and frailties of every other human being. His ability to recognise his own human frailties and vulnerabilities keeps him grounded and allows him to be compassionate to others in their weakness.

Throughout the scriptures we see this desire to refuse to deny the dark side of things. Indeed failure and sin are seen as part of life and don’t inhibit someone from reaching their potential as long as they take time to recognise their mistakes and look for help. Jesus is never upset at even the worst kind of sinners, he mixes with prostitutes and tax collectors, with adulterers and murderers. He puts up with people who have betrayed him and welcomes them back into the fold. He only gets upset with people who do not think they are sinners! This is why he finds himself in conflict with the religious leaders of the day - and often uses controversial stories and images to break through their self-importance.

When Jesus begins preaching in Jerusalem he draws the attention of the chief priests and elders of the people when he enters the Temple and furiously drives out the merchants and the moneychangers. (Matthew 21:12). He questions the legitimacy of their religious practices while the poor and the widows are being neglected. Unsettled by Jesus’ preaching, the chief priests and elders begin to question his authority and end up in a debate with him. It is in the course of that debate that Jesus tells them the parable we heard in today’s Gospel (Matthew 21:28-32) where a father has two sons. He tells the first son to go to work in the vineyard, but he refuses, then later changes his mind and goes. The second son, on the other hand, pays honour to his father. “Certainly, sir” he says, but in fact doesn’t go. Jesus concludes the parable with a real shocker when he declares “I tell you solemnly, tax collectors and prostitutes are making their way into the Kingdom of God before you.”

The two sons mentioned in the parable represent two different groups of people. The son who said 'yes' but did not follow through on his commitment represented the Jewish people, who claimed to be a Godly nation, yet they neglected the most vulnerable in their society like the poor and the widows and orphans, and instead used religious rules and laws to justify their lack of action. The second son, who said he would not go but later decided to do what his father asked is not a model son either, but is definitely the better of the two, because he eventually did what the father wanted of him. Jesus likens that son to the tax collectors and sinners, who came to listen to John the Baptist and repented of their sins. In a total reversal of the status quo the sinners and the tax collectors who avail themselves of God’s mercy are considered righteous, whereas the privileged, who see no need of repentance are condemned for their arrogance.

A key aspect of the gospel is the realisation that none of us are perfect. All of us are in need of salvation. The danger is that when we start comparing ourselves to others, when we measure our righteousness in terms of someone else’s unworthiness, or when we rely on our position in society to measure our worthiness, we begin to lose our way. Each of us is judged according to our own gifts and according to the life that we live. The gospel invites us to put Christ at the centre of our lives and to let him be the measure of who we are.

‘Why are you doing this all alone…?’

- Often in life, we end up trying to handle everything ourselves.
- We think we have ‘broad shoulders’ and so we carry unnecessary weight.
- There are others who can help you along the way if you will just ask.
- The Lord is also your Helper, and you can have confidence in His help.

Have you ever taken time to reflect on what you have inherited - I am not talking about material things like a house or money or jewellery - but about the influences that have shaped your life and brought you to the place that you are right now? I am talking about the broad array of influences that have helped form our perspective and understanding of who we are. Some of them are obvious like the family and society we were born into; others maybe not be so obvious such as the men and women who have gone before us, who have fought for the liberation and education that has benefited our lives; or the inventors, doctors and scientists who have made discoveries that have made our life easier, or more complicated as the case may be; the poets, musicians and story tellers who, through music and verse, have nourished our soul. Then of course there is the reason that we are here - the influence of the men and women of faith who have helped guide our life. Some did a great job and helped make the world a better place – others maybe didn’t do as well.

Of course not everything we have inherited has been great, particularly the unquestioned prejudices and biases that have crept in to our daily living, even as we profess to be Christian. So how do we make sense of it all? Here we are standing on the shoulders of our spiritual ancestors striving to do the right thing. How faithful are we to the promises we made when we said yes to giving our life to Christ, to living by the values of the gospel. Do we stand up for what is right and true, or do we give in to the dominant culture? What will our legacy be? Will our children and grandchildren take their direction from how we have lived? Will they see us as people who were faithful to God’s word, or as people who failed to question the numerous injustices and inequalities that surround us.

Today’s scripture readings are about inheritance and promise. They are  about faithfulness and legacy. Jesus is addressing the leaders of the Chosen people. Remember these are the people who had made a promise, a covenant with God to live in harmony with God and one another. Through God’s grace the Hebrew nation had been formed into a people who knew the one true God and who were entrusted with the special role of bringing God’s love to the world. Theirs was a privileged inheritance, a priceless vocation that somehow slipped through their fingers, as they gradually let go of the promises they had made to God. They forgot who they were meant to be, how their lives were meant to produce the fruits of righteousness, justice and mercy; how care and compassion, peace and harmony were meant to be the measure of who they were. Instead they judged people on their ability to comply with rules and regulations and ended up creating a society where status and privilege were seen as gifts given by God to the deserving few who could keep the rules, while poverty and sickness were expressions of God’s disdain for the unworthy.

When Jesus addressed the chief priests and elders of the people he used the familiar image of the vineyard that is found in the book of Isaiah (Isaiah 5:1-7).He tells the story of a landowner who leases his vineyard to tenants, and goes on a journey. The owner of the land doesn’t just give them an empty piece of ground, rather he first plants it himself, put a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a tower (Matthew 21:33-43). In other words he gave them everything they needed to live full and productive lives. The landowner trusts the tenants and leaves them to their work unhindered. At harvest time he sends his servants to obtain his produce and we heard how that ended.

When he finished his story Jesus asks his hearers what they think the owner of the vineyard will do. Of course it is obvious, he will find someone else to do the work, someone that will give him the produce at harvest time. Instantly they realise that Jesus is in fact speaking about them, and that he is accusing them of not being faithful to their covenant, their promise to God, and that there are consequences to such unfaithfulness.

Of course the parable is not only about Israel and the chosen people, it is about us too. We are the tenants in the vineyard today.  

God’s patience with us is evident throughout the gospels. In many different ways, and through the people we meet, God sends us all sorts of invitations and opportunities to widen our hearts and adjust our attitudes. Time and again he calls us to the gospel values of hospitality, generosity, community, respect, integrity, love of neighbour and an openness to the divine. He expect us to live with justice in our hearts and to stand up for the oppressed. These are all aspects of our inheritance. In some way these are the values that make us human, and offer us the greatest hope of happiness.

So what are these scriptures saying to me and what will my response be? The time for us to produce the fruits of the harvest is now. Is there something that I need to change, so that I am more faithful to the Gospel. When my children and grandchildren look back on my life will they be able to say with pride that my parents, my grandparents, my brother / sister we were people of faith, people of integrity, people who made the world a better place. Is that who I am? Is that who I want to be?

The South African Weather Service has warned of disruptive rainfall expected in Nelson Mandela Bay from Friday, 9 October 2020 until the early hours of Saturday, 10 October 2020.

Heavy showers that will cause localised flooding in places along the coast have been predicted overnight until Saturday morning. According to SAWS “the persistence of rain overnight will result in localised flooding in places”. This includes informal settlements, roads, low-lying areas and bridges.

SAWS forecaster Stephanie Hinze said: “There will be difficult driving conditions on dirt roads and minor vehicle accidents due to slippery roads. There could be short term disruptions to essential services with blocked drainage systems. ,There is a chance of localised mudslides and rock falls.”

“We advise residents to listen to the radio or television for warnings and obey the instructions from Disaster Management.”

NMBM Safety and Security Porfolio Head, Councillor Queenie Pink said: “Ward Councillors are encouraged to find alternative accommodation for the residents who reside in areas that often get flooded during heavy rains. Our Disaster Management unit is ready to assist when needed across the City. We urge our residents to take the warning seriously and be alert during the weekend.”

Thank you.

Imagine getting an invitation to some high profile function like the inauguration of Nelson Mandela when he was installed as President of South Africa, or to the wedding of William and Kate or any other big event. It is unlikely that we would forget that we were invited or simply let the event pass by without a second thought. Similarly in Jesus time, it would have been considered a great honour to be invited to a wedding banquet, especially if the person doing the inviting was a king and the invitation was to his son’s wedding. Such invitations don’t come along every day, so when they do most people would jump at the opportunity.

In today’s Gospel (Matthew 22:1-14) however we see how an invitation to the King’s banquet is not only turned down by several people who are busy with their day to day lives, but is actually refused by some who even become violent towards the king’s messengers. This was strange behaviour indeed and must have caused Jesus’ listeners to wonder why anyone would miss the opportunity to share in what would most certainly have been a great feast. There was nothing to be lost and everything to be gained by simply accepting the invitation.

It is important to remember that when Jesus addressed the chief priests and elders of the people he was using a parable. A parable is a story that simply takes illustrations from life as it is, neither praising nor criticising the behaviour involved but simply using the way people (including kings) behave to illustrate what the story teller wants to convey. Usually the listeners are left in sufficient doubt about its precise meaning or application that they have to actively engage with the story to tease out what the storyteller is trying to say. It was a common teaching method used by Jesus to get people to take on board what he was saying, while allowing his listeners the opportunity to draw their own conclusions about his teaching and its implication for their current way of life.

That being said, Jesus uses the parable of the King’s invitation as an allegory, or a metaphor, for God’s gracious invitation to a new life that is extended to each one of us. It is similar to the King’s invitation to a banquet where we will experience life as we have never experienced it before. There is nothing to be lost and everything to be gained by responding positively to this invitation. It comes to us through Jesus who declared that he has come that we “might have life and have it in it’s fullness” (John 10:10). It is an invitation that has our best interests at heart and one we would be foolish to pass up on, yet that is often what we do.

How many times in our life do we neglect the prompting of the Holy Spirit? How many times do we let our work or sport commitments or some other excuse take precedent over our relationship with God. And even when we do accept the invitation, do we do so with enthusiasm and commitment. Do we work diligently at changing our own behaviour and making the world a better place, while surrendering our lives to the love of God in such a way that we live no longer for ourselves, but for Christ who lives in us. (Galatians 2:20).

In baptism we accepted the invitation to live as God’s people. We committed our lives to Christ, to “clothe ourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience (Colossians 3:12), as St Paul puts it, so that we might make God’s love known in our lives and in the world. Every time we profess our faith or turn to God in prayer; every time we act with justice and integrity; every time we acknowledge God’s presence in the ‘other’ and in the world we reaffirm that commitment and live up to the promise that we have made.

There are times however when we fall down on our commitment, when we live from a place of selfishness rather than a place of love; when we overlook the prompting of the Holy Spirit and carry on as if God is irrelevant. It seems that Matthew addresses this reality in the second part of today’s parable when he introduces the man who failed to wear the expected wedding garment. He represents us, or other Christians who should know better, who have turned our back on God’s grace. What is interesting is the fact that, for now, we are all at the banquet (in the church) together, good and not so good alike, but there will come a time of reckoning. The scene evokes images of the last judgment when all who call themselves Christian will come face to face with God who makes the final judgement on who will enter the eternal banquet.

Now is the time to weave the garment of love. We do that by accepting God’s grace and taking responsible for our lives; by living lives worthy of that grace and by being proud and grateful for all that God has given us. It is by making our own the line in today’s psalm when we prayed “surely goodness and kindness shall follow me all the days of my life.” (Psalm 23:6). What an amazing testimony that would be to God’s grace at work in me!

Franz Jagerstatter was an Austrian farmer who was beatified in 2007, sixty four years after being executed by Hitler’s Nazi government. There was nothing about Franz in his younger life to suggest that he had the stuff of martyrs in him. He was an ordinary man who, like many in his day, left school at an young age and worked as a farm labourer. He and his wife and family were regular church goer but wouldn’t have described themselves as overly religious.

When Franz was about thirty six years old, the Second World War was raging, and he was called to serve in Hitler’s army. He refused to join because he believe that the war was unjust, and so made the decision to become a conscientious objector. His friends raised questions about his loyalty to his county and to the flag, but he wouldn’t be swayed. He said “I love my people and I love my country, but there’s a higher law, God’s law, and God’s law tells me that this war is wrong.” Even his wife begged him to reconsider his decision for the sake of his family and children, but to no avail. He knew well the consequences of his refusal, but would not change his mind. On the 9th August 1943, he was put to death. It wasn’t that he wanted to die. He simply believed that there was something more at stake.  For him, there was no question but that his faith was meant to shape his life. For many however, especially in these days, there is a desire that religious matters be kept separate from politics. But is that even possible?

There is no doubt that there have been times when church leaders and individual Christians have made dangerous mistakes in the political arena. It seems unimaginable, for example, that the scriptures were used to justify apartheid in South Africa. However, it is also true that the church played a significant role in the dismantling of apartheid. The fact is that we live in the world. We are part of society whether we want to be or not. It is not possible to live in isolation, to be completely cut off from every-thing and every-one around us, to not be influenced by the people we meet and the ideologies that call out for our allegiance. The reality is that the choices we make, or don’t make, and the actions that result, in turn influences others. As such, the role of the institutional church is not meant to be a political force in itself so that it can influence the politics of nations and grow in its own earthly power and wealth, rather, its role is one where it helps people to understand more fully the values of the gospel so that people of faith will be empowered to make decisions that benefit the common good and help to create a world where respect and love of neighbour are the measure of who we are.

The question of religion and politics is brought to the fore in the gospel today. (Matthew 22: 15-21). The Pharisees raise the issue of paying taxes to the Romans as a way of trapping Jesus. It is a loaded question and is meant to undermine Jesus regardless of how he answered it. If he said they should pay taxes to Caesar, then he would lose his credibility with the Jews. If he said that it was wrong to pay taxes to Caesar, then he was committing a public act of treason and the Romans could arrest Him. Jesus is aware of their deception but nevertheless asks to see one of the coins with which the taxes were to be paid. In doing so he is telling the crowd that he does not have the emperor’s coins, but that his hypocritical questioners do. The possession of the coin is an implicit acknowledgment of Roman sovereignty. The coin of course showed the image of Caesar with an inscription proclaiming his authority. By referring to Caesar’s image Jesus reminds his listeners of a very familiar text in Genesis which declares that we are  made in God’s image. (Genesis 1:27). Just as the coin bearing the image of Caesar belongs to Caesar, the human person, bearing the image of God, belongs to God. So Jesus simply says, “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what belongs to God.” Jesus’ response is significant in that he doesn’t deny that we have a responsibility to civil power, but he does contextualise that responsibility within the broader and higher framework of obedience to God.

Perhaps in our time, however, the choice is not so much between God and a civil authority, as it is about choosing what suits me best, rather than thinking of the common good. Where is God when I have to make a difficult moral decision; or when I determine how much I am going to share with the poor; or when I witness an injustice; or when I make a choice between defending my faith and hiding my belief’s in silence? In truth we often put ourselves first. We make decisions and choices that favour our own circumstances; that ensures the comfort of those we love and safeguards a pleasant future for ourselves.

This gospel however doesn’t let us off the hook. It reminds us that everything belongs to God! Everything that we have, everything that we claim as our own, be it wealth or talent or time, is on loan to us from God. It is God’s gift to me to be used not only for my own good, but for the good of others.  So what might this gospel be asking of me? Maybe it’s asking me to take time to look again at where I put my allegiance? Do I put God first or is there something that I need to change?

2020/10/25, 12:32 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 30th Sunday - Cycle A, 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story about a man who had a huge rock in his front garden. As time went on he got tired of looking at the big unattractive stone and decided that he would try and turn it into an object of art. He went to work on it with hammer and chisel, and chipped away at the huge rock until it became a beautiful stone elephant. When he finished, it looked really great, and added a certain beauty to his garden. One day a neighbour asked him "How did you ever carve such a marvellous likeness of an elephant?" The man answered, "I just chipped away everything that didn't look like an elephant!"

That is a great story and can easily be related to our lives. Our lives are full of potential. We have so much to offer, but very often get caught up focussing on our “unattractive parts”, rather than the beauty that is within. Our gospel today invites us to reflect on the great commandment which speaks about love of God and love of neighbour (Matthew 22: 34 - 40). Love is the key to being in right relationship with God and our neighbour, but it starts with us being able to love ourselves, to see the incredible potential within, and be believing in our own self-worth.
G. K. Chesterton the well-known poet and author would often say that the great lesson of “beauty and the beast” is that a thing must be loved before it is loveable. 

There is a great truth in this. We cannot give what we do not have. Love begins within us when we are loved for who we are, not for what we do or what we might become. It is an unconditional love that usually begin in our family where we are nurtured and helped to discover our full potential.
Unfortunately there are times when this does not happen for a multitude of reasons, and we are left scarred and broken with a low sense of self-worth. It is at such times that we need to remember that ultimately we are God’s creation. We are made in his image, well-made, God’s work of art. There is a beautiful, noble, perfect ‘me’ within, that may be hidden, even from my own view. If that is the case, if there is anything in my life that doesn’t build me up, that doesn’t respect me for the beautiful person that I am, that doesn’t love ‘me’, but only loves something that I am good at, then I need to chip it away with the help of God. If I have anything in my life that doesn’t look life self-compassion, self-forgiveness, self-love, then I need to chip it away, to discover the beauty of who I really am. If bitterness or hatred, or hurt or vengeance or envy are part of my life right now, with the help of God, I need to chip them away, for my sake and the sake of the other. 

There is a beauty and a freedom that comes to our lives as we begin to discover who we really are, when we allow love to touch us deeply, to heal us and redeem us as we begin to see our true potential and not simply be overwhelmed by our frailties or short comings.

As we begin to love ourselves, we develop the capacity to love others. Loving others is about accepting them for who they are, without any expectations. Thomas Merton, one of the great spiritual writers in modern times, wrote “The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them.” He goes on to say “Our job is to love others without stopping to inquire whether or not they are worthy. That is not our business and, in fact, it is nobody's business. What we are asked to do is to love, and this love itself will render both ourselves and our neighbours worthy.”

It is not easy to live as a Christian, to love our neighbour. We live in a society that constantly measures a person in terms of what they do, or what they have, rather than who they are. The gospel challenges us to be countercultural, to live with different values to the dominant culture today, just as the early Christian did. In the second reading (1Thessalonians 1: 5 -10) Paul acknowledges the Thessalonians for their faith and love for outsiders. “They turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God.” They embraced a life of faith, hope and love in contrast to non-believers, and reached out to others beyond their borders. In the same way we are challenged to be a kinder, more inclusive community where respect and care can serve as a cure to the politics of fear and division that currently shapes our society.

A good test to see how we reflect God’s love is to be found in St. Paul’s letter to the Corinthians. Love is always patient and kind, it is never boastful, jealous or conceited. It is never rude or selfish; it does not take offence and is not resentful’ etc. (1 Corinthians 13). It is easy to put the name of Jesus in the place of love in that text, but can we put our own name there, and if not, why not? Do we still have work to do in loving ourselves? Is there still something that we need to be chipping away at, so that we can come to understand what true love looks like?

‘Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.’

- In this story, a great miracle was about to take place.
- The Lord did four things: He looked to heaven, He blessed, He broke and He gave.
- This can be the story of our lives, as we take what He gives us, and give it away.
- Before the miracle, He looked to heaven, did the possible, and God did the impossible.

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, as I trust You for miracles in my life and circumstances, may I always remember to look to You, as the source of my miracle. May I be ready to take what You have given and done for me, and use it to be a blessing to others, in the Name of Jesus. Amen www.AlivetoGod.com

2020/11/08, 21:26 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 32nd Sunday - Cycle A - 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

A young man applied for a job as a farm hand. When asked for his qualifications, he said, "I can sleep when the wind blows." This puzzled the farmer, but he liked the young man and hired him. A few days later the farmer and his wife were awakened in the middle of the night by a violent storm. They quickly began to check things out to see if everything was secure. They found that the shutters of the farmhouse had been securely fastened. A good supply of wood had been set next to the fireplace. The farm implements had been placed in the storage shed, safe from the storm and the tractor had been moved into the garage. The barn had been properly locked. Everything was fine. Even the animals were calm. It was then that the farmer grasped the meaning of the young man’s words, "I can sleep when the wind blows." Because the farm hand had performed his work loyally and faithfully when the skies were clear, he was prepared for the storm when it broke. Consequently, when the wind blew, he had no fear. He was able to sleep in peace.

Over the past few days the world has looked on while the US made a decision as to who will be their president for the next 4 years. The process has been a study in contrasts, and in some ways a modern adaptation of today’s parable (Matthew 25.1-13). One of the candidates has remained calm and dignified and presented an air of confidence that says we are ready for this, whatever the outcome might be. The other has acted with petulance and mistrust and has frantically rushed to blame the opposition for his poor performance. One prepared diligently and calmly and promised to put the nation first. The other also promised to put the nation first, but his track record tells another story. At the end of the day of course the outcome of the election was not a snap decision, made on election day alone, but a judgement by the people on how the incumbent performed over the past four years. In some ways it was a moment of reckoning, something that we will all have to face at some time in our lives. Just like the farmhand who wasn’t worried about the possibility of a storm, because he was ready, there will come a time when our track record will be all we have to rely on.

In our gospel today we hear the story of the 10 bridesmaids who went out to meet the bridegroom. In Jewish culture it was the custom that the bride, along with her bridesmaids, would meet the groom at the gate of the city and then accompany him to her home. The story goes that five of the bridesmaids came prepared for the possibility of a long wait and so brought some extra oil for their lamps, while the other five did not. The bridegroom is delayed for quite some time, and the bridesmaids fall asleep. When the announcement is finally made that he is on his way, all ten bridesmaids wake up and prepare for his arrival. During the long night however, the lamps had run out of oil. This was not a problem for those who had planned ahead and who thought to bring extra oil, but those with no oil were left scrambling to get their affairs in order at the last moment. Those who had no oil tried to borrow from those who had, but were denied and had to run to the market to try to find someone who would sell them some. In the meantime the bridegroom arrives and those who were prepared go in to the feast. The door was closed, and those not prepared were left outside.

At first observation the refusal of the wise bridesmaids to share their oil may seem selfish. But we must remember that this is a parable, and that at the end of the day it is not really about lamps and oil but about people and life. It is about how prepared we are to meet the bridegroom, Christ. When it comes to that moment we will need to rely on our own resources, because there are certain things we cannot borrow or inherit. For example our parents and grandparents may be great people. If that is the case then we are very lucky. The reality of course is that just because our parents are good people doesn’t mean that we will automatically become decent caring men and women. We can learn from them and be inspired by them, but there comes a time when we have to make the choices that will determine our own life and destiny. The reality is that we shape our own destiny. Character cannot be transferred or borrowed. We must build it for ourselves.

The same is true of faith. Love for Christ is not something we can borrow from someone else. We can witness the faith of our family or members of our community and be inspired by their commitment and dedication, their love for God and the people around them, but there comes a time when we have to make that choice for ourselves, to invite Christ into our lives and heart, or not.

Today’s gospel ends with the caution “keep awake therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour.” It reminds me of an old Irish proverb, Ní hé lá na gaoithe lá na scolb. (The day of the wind is not the day of the thatch) in other words we need to prepare for what is to come. And when we do, we, like the young farm hand, will be able to sleep when the winds blows, because there will be nothing to fear.

‘The LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend.’

- There is a depth to our relationship with God that we have yet to discover.
- There are far greater dimensions for us still to pursue and experience.
- The Lord desires that His presence would be a living reality in our lives.
- Do not hold back, press on, and press into more of God.

2020/11/15, 15:11 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 32nd Sunday - Cycle A - 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

In the 1960’s there was a woman by the name of Phyllis Diller who became a very popular stand-up comedian. At the height of her career she was making over a million dollars a year, a nice bit of change back in the 60’s. But it wasn’t always like that. Diller tells how, when she was younger, she would go to the movies and think, “If only I had her looks,” or  she would listen to a singer and say to herself, “If only I had her voice.” Then one day someone gave her a copy of the book, The Magic of Believing. She says that after she read that book, she stopped comparing herself with others, focussing on what she didn’t have, and instead concentrated on what she did have. She realised that her ability to make people laugh was one of her gifts, and so decided to trust herself and audition for an opening in an upcoming show. From there her career took off. 
 
In today’s Gospel we hear the parable of the talents. While at first hearing it may sound like Jesus is promoting the wise use of the rich man’s wealth - it soon becomes apparent that there is a deeper meaning. We are told that there is a rich man who is about to go on a journey. Before he departs he gives a very large sum of money to three of his servants. The first gets ten talents, the second, five and the third, one. By the way, one talent was the equivalent of twenty years wages for an ordinary worker. When the talents are handed over, the rich man doesn’t give any instructions as to how the money should be used, he simply entrusts it to each of the servants. As it turns out the first two servants doubled the man’s investment, while the one-talent man dug a hole in the ground and buried his.

As the story unfolds it becomes obvious that the parable is a metaphor for our lives. The focus is not so much on the money that the rich man gave to the servants, but on what the servants did with the opportunity they were given. Two of them believed in themselves and looked for ways in which to improves their lot, and they did just that, whereas one doubted himself, gave in to fear and ultimately ended up burying the gift he had been given. When questioned by the master on his return the man who received the one talent replied, 'Master, I knew you were a demanding person, harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter; so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground.” Fear is a crippling emotion that robs us of the gift of faith. It causes us to act small and to live with distrust in our lives, all elements that limit our possibilities. In the parable it wasn’t the harshness of the master that prevented the man from using his talent, nor was it lack of opportunity, it was the fact that he allowed his fear, his doubt in his own ability, to control the outcome of his life.

While fear has the ability to limit our existence, faith helps us to see new possibilities, to see light where others might only see darkness. Faith unleashes within us our true potential, an inner strength that sometimes lies hidden. It frees us to explore more fully who we are meant to be and helps us to see beyond our shortcomings and limitations. Faith helps us to work with what we have with the sure knowledge that our life has purpose and meaning. It reminds us that our lives are a gift from God, and that the greatest way to give glory to God is to be the person we are meant to be.

In today’s parable we see that each servant was given something. No one was left idle. We may not be five-talent people, but each of us has some talent. We all do. Ultimately, it doesn’t matters how many gifts we have, what matters is what we do with what we have.  

As we come to the end of the liturgical year, our readings reminds us that this life too will come to an end and that each of us will be asked to give an account of our lives. We don’t know when that will happen, but happen it will. What will we be able to offer to the Lord? What will be the fruit of our living? Each of us will be judged on our own merits, on who we were meant to be. Let us use our time well, so that when the Lord comes, we will hear him say: “Well done, my good and faithful servant!… Come and share the joy of your master”

Alex Haley, the author of _Roots_ tells the story of how his father, Simon, had his life changed by a simple act of kindness. Simon was the youngest of eight children and grew up in a poor farming family. Everyone in the family was needed to help with the crops.  After a few years of schooling the children were expected to leave school and to work on the farm. Fortunately for Simon, his mother intervened on his behalf and he was allowed to stay in school. After graduating high school, he studied at the _Lane Institute,_ working as many as four jobs while studying full-time. Every summer he worked as a porter on a train. On one occasion he met a passenger who was impressed with his work ethic and the fact that he was working to earn money to pay his college fees. At the end of the trip he tipped him the unimaginable sum of five dollars – a lot of money at the beginning of the last century.

By the end of the summer Simon had to decide whether he should use his summer earnings to buy a mule and get a job hiring himself out to work on farms so that he could help feed his family, or if he should press ahead and try and finish his last year at college. Even though it was going to be tough financially he opted for college.  Alex Haley recalls how, when his Dad arrived on campus, the president called him into his office and showed him a letter he had just received.  The letter was from the elderly man whom Simon had met on the train, and it contained a cheque for five hundred and eighteen dollars which was to be used to cover his tuition and living expenses for one full year.

The kindness of an unknown friend made all the difference in the life of Simon Haley, Alex Haley himself, and every succeeding generation of that family. A single act of kindness has the power to change someone’s life. It can be a word of encouragement, a hand up, or a moment of forgiveness. Whatever it might be, it benefits both the giver and the receiver. The receiver benefits from the help given in whatever way it was needed, and the giver benefits from the action itself, a moment when love becomes real. It is such moments that reveal to us what it is to be truly human. It is when we learn to love, truly love, by letting go of our own self-interest, and we grow in our ability to share our life with another, that we become the best version of ourselves. As we learn to give without counting the cost we help to make the world a better place, more compatible with God’s plan for our lives and the world.

In our gospel today we hear the parable of the Sheep and the Goats (Matthew 25: 31-46) and we see what love in action looks like. While the parable is fundamentally about the final judgment, at the end of time, it is also a commentary on what constitutes a life well lived in the eyes of Christ. There is no mention of prayer, or religious practices, or even a profession of faith. There is nothing about church attendance or participating in the sacraments. What is included however is a review of how we have lived our life, how we have cared for each other. It is significant that Jesus puts particularly emphasise on how we look after the most vulnerable in society: those who suffer from hunger or thirst, the naked, the stranger, the sick and those in prison.

What surprises both the faithful and the unfaithful in the parable of the final judgment is the revelation that God is fully present in the most unlikely of people, the prisoner, the stranger, the impoverished. It is the people who have integrated the care of others into their life - where the care of others has become so much part of their life that they don’t have to make a conscious decision to do it - that are rewarded. It is how they have lived that is rewarded.

As the church year comes to an end this week, we are invited to reflect also on our own end, our mortality and what eternity means for us. Thomas Aquinas, a hugely influential philosopher and theologian who lived in the 13th century, declares that God and eternity are the same. When we go from here, we go to God. How we experience the Divine Presence depends on whether our lives have become fully compatible with Love. In other words, if we have lived from a place of love, there will be nothing to fear. As we come together today, let us pray once again for the grace to overcome our own selfish interests as we strive to live as people of love.

2020/11/29, 12:59 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 1st Sunday Advent - B - 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

Dear friends, This has been a very busy week for me, preparing to return to South Africa and putting final arrangements in place before I left home. I arrived back in Port Elizabeth last night and am happy to be home. 

Given the busy-ness of the week, I didn’t get to prepare a homily, so I decided to share a short reflection from one of my previous homilies for the first Sunday of Advent – with a few edits. 

*****************
When I was in my early 20’s, a friend and I travelled across the United States from New York to California - about 4600km of a road trip. We had agreed to take turns at the wheel, so that neither of us would get too tired while driving. On one occasion, after a long day on the road, it was again my turn to drive. In the beginning all went well, but then I started to get drowsy. I can remember telling myself that it was okay, that we only had to go a little further and that I would be fine. But then, for a split second, I dozed off and the car began to veer off the road. Thankfully my co-pilot was more awake than I was and shouted at me. I quickly woke up and managed to pull the car back on track. Then I did what I should have done earlier, pulled off the road, and let someone else drive. 

In our spiritual life something similar can happen. We can be going about our day to day lives, busy with many things, caught up in the routine of life, pushing on to the next goal, while all the time we are drifting spiritually. We ignore the warning signs that all is not well. Often it begins with being too busy to go to church, or maybe we allow something into our home or our life that is questionable or inappropriate! Maybe it is not paying enough attention to our relationships and failing to honour our commitments; or perhaps we are not making enough time for prayer. It could be that we allow our position, our wealth or our education to become stumbling blocks in our relationships, thinking that they make us more worthy that another. 

It is as if we gradually fall asleep to who we are meant to be, forgetting that our choice to accept Christ into our lives also means choosing to live with certain values in our day to day life. It is then that we start to veer off the path. We begin to live disconnected lives doing our own thing, rather than living as God called us to. If we are blessed we wake up in time to realise that we are on the path to destruction, and we get the opportunity to reassess our lives. 

Stay Awake is the theme of this first Sunday of Advent. It is a time when we are invited to ‘pull over to the side’ and to reassess our lives and see what need  to change. The master of the house is the Lord . He is coming at the end of our lives. If he comes and finds us ready and waiting, the door of our life open to his presence, then we have nothing to worry about. If he comes and finds us spiritually asleep, then we may lose the opportunity to share eternity with him. 

God’s word invites us to reassess where we are right now. Are we living as people of God, alert and alive to the possibilities that life offers? Do we give witness to the values of Christ in our lives in the way we treat one another? Are we awake to the times when God extends his love to us, more than we can imagine? Do we watch for the times when we give witness to his love by our service to others? Are we awake to the times when we can draw closer to him through prayer and sacrifice? Do we watch for the times when we can let go of selfishness so that we might grow in his love? 

Advent is a lovely season that offers us hope. Let us pray for the grace to open our lives to God’s love, and the courage to live as Christian with integrity.

‘The Lord worked with them.’

- The secret to success, is in knowing that God is working with you.
- As you do your part, and trust and obey Him, He will do His part.
- This partnership is part of the blessing we can know, as His children.
- Let us believe that He is with us, and working all things out for our good.

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, what a joy it is to know that You work with Your children, to bring about Your purposes and plans. Help me to do my part, with the full confidence that You will do Your part, and that I will see the wonderful results, in the Name of Jesus. Amen. www.AlivetoGod.com

- When we are facing challenges and insecurity, we can get discouraged.

- Today, the Lord wants to say to you: ‘Do not be discouraged!’
- The Lord will fight for you, because He loves and cares for you.

2020/12/06, 12:40 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 2nd Sunday Advent B - 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

In one of her books, Sue Monk Kidd, a spiritual writer and publisher, recalls her youth and how she would prepare for Christmas. In early December, she would sit near the Crib and think over the last year of her life. She would think deeply about Christmas and the coming of Jesus. She remembers how, one time, she visited a monastery a couple of weeks before Christmas. She was walking in the grounds when she passed a monk. She greeted him, saying "Merry Christmas." The monk's response caught her off guard a bit. He said "May Christ be born in you." His words seemed a bit strange and not what one would normally expect to hear. She wondered what he meant by them. "May Christ be born in you?" At the time she was unsure, but now all these years later, sitting beside the Crib, she felt the impact of his words. She discovered that Advent is a time of spiritual preparation. It is a time of discovering our soul and letting Christ be born into our waiting heart."

In both the first reading today (Isaiah 40:1-5 9-11) and the gospel (Mark 1:1-8) we hear this invitation to prepare the way of the Lord.  Isaiah was speaking to a dispirited people, who had turned away from the Lord, a people who had lost faith in themselves and in God’s ability to overlook their sin. Isaiah offers a word of comfort and helps the people to see new possibilities, even in such desperate times. He reminds them, and us, that we are never beyond redemption, because God is still God, even if we have chosen to turn away from his love.

In the gospel reading John the Baptist proclaims the same message, while making us aware that the one who is coming after him is much greater than he is.

In the Jewish rabbinic tradition, there was a custom where students carried the sandals of their teachers as a mark of respect, but John says that he is not even worthy to untie the sandals of the One who is to come. In other words, John is pointing us towards the messiah, and is letting us know that we need to prepare for his coming. 

In order to prepare, we have to first rediscover our soul, so to speak,  that part of us from which our life flows, and perhaps recognise again how we have been made for greatness. Over time we may have forgotten who we really are, listening instead to messages of that undermine our sense self-worth, but Advent announces that there is nothing to fear. It dares us to believe that our deepest longings for life, for love, for peace, for self fulfillment, are in fact God’s own desire for us too.

Once we begin to trust ourselves, to see the beauty of who we can be, we instinctively begin to live from that place, and start to let go of the all that has hampered our living. This is not easy to do, because we have to learn to let go of some of the messages we have internalised over the years, that we are not good enough, or that we are not worthy, or that we are too broken, when we manage to do that, we begin to live life to the full.  

There is a passage in the Jewish Yom Kippur liturgy, that speaks of this reality, the difficulty of change, and the new life that it brings. It goes:  ''Now is the time for turning. The leaves are beginning to turn from green to red to orange. The birds are beginning to turn and are heading once more toward the south. The animals are beginning to turn to storing their food for the winter. For leaves, birds and animals, turning comes instinctively. But for us, turning does not come so easily. It takes an act of will for us to make a turn. It means breaking old habits. It means admitting that we have been wrong, and this is never easy. It means losing face. It means starting all over again. And this is always painful. It means saying I am sorry. It means recognizing that we have the ability to change. These things are terribly hard to do. But unless we turn, we will be trapped forever in yesterday's ways.”

Advent calls us to let go of our smallness in favour of purpose, our resentment in favour of love, our envy in favour of contentment, our laziness in favour of discipline, our fear in favour of faith. It invites us to turn again to the Lord, who desires to be fully present to us, in spite of our limitations.  It is a time when we are invited to open our lives again to God who is coming to meet us – that is what Christmas is about – the incarnation, God becoming one of us. If that is true then surely that means that we have been deemed worthy.

So today, as we gather here, we are invited to take a moment again to pray for the grace to see ourselves as God sees us; to trust that he wants the best for each of us; and to allow ourselves to hope that the best is yet to come.

2020/12/13, 14:12 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 3rd Sunday Advent - B - 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told by Rabbi Hugo Gryn about how, when he was a young boy, he and his family were sent to Auschwitz. Soon after arriving there his grandfather and one of his brothers were sent to the gas chambers. Hugo and his father were sent to be part of a work party and ended up sharing the same barracks.

In spite of the awful hardship, oppression and persecution that the prisoners experienced, many continued to practice their Jewish faith in whatever way they could. In the middle of winter, the Jews normally celebrate Chanukah, the Jewish festival of lights. Hugo tell how his father constructed a little Chanukah menorah out of scrap metal. For a wick, he took some threads from his prison uniform, and for oil, he used some butter that he somehow obtained from a guard.

Despite the fact that these religious rituals were forbidden, they were willing to take the risk, so that they could give thanks to God. Apart from the risk itself, Hugo wondered about the wisdom of “wasting” precious food and suggested that it might be better to share the butter on a crust of bread than to burn it? Later he recalled how his father said to him “Hugo, both you and I know that a person can live a very long time without food. But Hugo, I tell you, a person cannot live a single day without hope. This Menorah is the fire of hope. Never let it go out. Not here. Not anywhere.  

Today we celebrate the Third Sunday of Advent – a day that is also known as Gaudete Sunday or Rejoice Sunday. In some ways it seems strange to talk of rejoicing in the midst of a pandemic. We are surrounded by illness and disease. Fear is holding us ransom, and far too many are weeping for the death of loves ones. It doesn’t feel like a time for rejoicing, a time of celebration, and yet it is now more than ever that we cannot allow the flame of faith to go out.

In the first reading today (Isaiah 61:1-2a,10-11) Isaiah speaks to the Jewish people who are in exile in Babylon. They are far from their homeland, feeling alone and abandoned by God. Isaiah encourages them to see that even in the worst of times, new life is possible. Using images of nature and life he reminds them “for as the earth makes fresh things grow, and as the garden makes seeds spring up, so will the Lord make both integrity and praise spring up.

In one of the _Living Faith_ reflections during the week, this theme of new life triumphing in almost impossible situations was beautifully illustrated when the author recalled how, after a flood in his basement, he had to hire some construction workers to modify the front of his house. This involved digging up the front yard and putting in a new stone yard in its place, which had a layer of nylon fabric underneath to prevent weeds and damp coming through. He tells how, later in the winter, he was amazed to see that a single crocus had sprouted in the middle of the stone walkway. He writes “How had a flowering plant punched through the desert of a nylon fabric base and layers of stones? For me, it was a small sign that new life can spring from apparent barrenness. A vivid reminder that “the hand of the Lord has done this” A reminder indeed, that no matter how dark our situation may seem, how hopeless things may appear, God can bring forth new life.

In the second reading (1 Thessalonians 5:16-24) Paul reminds the Thessalonians, who themselves are struggling with all kinds of issues, and us, to rejoice at all times, and to pray constantly giving thanks to God for all things. In other words, Paul is asking us to be grateful for what we have.

Have you ever noticed that there can be times when amidst all the things that we have, we focus on the one thing that we don’t have, or amidst all the good things that people say about us, we focus on the one negative thing that someone said, or how we let one failure rob us of our joy, while ignoring all our achievements. Sometimes we are more inclined to allow the negative to shape us, rather that focussing on the good. St Paul encourages us rather to rejoice, to be positive, to look for the light. It takes an act of the will, a choice on our behalf to look for the light. It is not easy, but that is what Isaiah did. It is what Hugo’s dad did in the concentration camps in the midst of all that was wrong. It is what Jesus did on the cross when he hung between two criminals. It is what we need to do, in a time when it is only too easy to be overwhelmed by all the negativity that is around us.

So today, let us take some time to see what is right with the world, what there is to be grateful for in our lives, for with gratitude, in time come joy.

I came across a quote from Frederick Buechner’s book _Peculiar Treasures_, where he takes the unusual approach of describing the scene of the annunciation, which we heard in our Gospel reading today (Luke 1:26-38), from the perspective of the Angel Gabriel.

Describing the angel’s response to the message he had to deliver he writes “She struck the angel Gabriel as hardly old enough to have a child at all, let alone this child, but he’d been entrusted with a message to give her and he gave it. He told her what the child was to be named, and who he was to be, and something about the mystery that was to come upon her. ‘You mustn’t be afraid, Mary,’ Gabriel told her. And as he said it, he only hoped she wouldn’t notice that beneath the great, golden wings, he himself was trembling with fear to think that the whole future of creation hung now on the answer of a girl.”

There is something beautiful in that perspective, that insight, something that speaks about the fragility of life, how tentative and delicate our relationship with God can be and consequently how difficult it is for most of us to trust that all will be well. From Buechner’s perspective even the angel trembled!  

There are so many times in our lives when we are left with questions, when the storms upset the balance, when the tranquillity gives way to worry, when pain robs our peace, when we are left wondering why does it have to be like this! Where is God in all of this? With Mary we may well ask “How can this be?”

It is in such times that we are inclined to question the delicate, fragile and tentative connection that defines our relationship with God and begin to wonder whether we wouldn’t be better off taking things into our own hands – taking charge of our own life, building our own defence structures, our own safety nets, trusting in our strength alone, rather than taking the risk of opening ourselves to something that is mystical, relational and so full of promise, yet so difficult to do. It is in that vulnerable place, that faith becomes real and we begin to transcend our fears and allow God to be God, or not.

Our readings today are a contrast in our human response to God. In our first reading (2 Samuel 7:1-5, 8b-12, 14a 16) we meet David, the shepherd who became King. He has had some powerful religious experiences in his day, and yet as he grows in human stature he seems to forget where the balance lies. Up until this point the Arc of the Covenant, the meeting place of God, was housed in a tent, a fragile movable enclosure that moved with the people wherever they went – a symbol of God abiding presence in their midst. But David, who is now a King, and reflecting on how his life has improved, makes the grave error of forgetting that it was the Lord who made him great and that there was nothing that David could give the Lord, that the Lord hadn’t already given David first. In some way, in wanting to build a house for the Lord, David was saying, I will look after God now. It is an error that is all too human. How often have we tried to tell God how to be God?

Very quickly however, the Lord speaks to David through the prophet Nathan, and reminds him “Who are you to build me a house? It was I who took you from the pasture, following sheep; I have been with you wherever you went; I have cut off your enemy, I will give you fame; I will provide a place for my people; I will plant them; I will appoint judges; I will give them rest. In the history of Israel that reminder to David came to have extraordinary significance when his descendants found themselves in difficulty, the prophets would recall David’s mistake and remind the people that God is a tent dwelling God - a God who moves with his people – and that there is nowhere, no battle ground, no sick bed, no act of betrayal, no broken home, where God is not to be found.

In our gospel today we see the fulfilment of Nathan’s prophecy when the angel of the Lord appears to Mary – who is of the house and line of David - and asks her to be the mother of God – the dwelling place of God. Her humble response becomes a profession of faith when she declares, “Let your will be done unto me.” It stands in contrast to the more human response of David who decided that HE would build a temple for God.” Mary’s response in faith and David’s human efforts to impress God are beautiful reminders that it is not because of human effort that God has made a home among us, but because God has taken the initiative. God has chosen us.

In baptism, we enter into this delicate, fragile bond with God in Christ. It is a thing of beauty that promises us the fulness of life, the key to eternal life, but it requires a response of trust and faith that this delicate, fragile relationship that we share with God has the grace and power to protect us, to provide for us, to hold us, to lead us, to open up the way for us. It’s not easy to give our lives over to the Lord, to become dependent on his wisdom and grace, but that is what the gospel invites us to do.

So today, as we gather here, as we prepare for the birth of the Christ Child, we are invited to look again at our relationship with God to see if it is based on faith and trust in God, or in our human desire to be in control. Mary trusted, and the word became flesh and the way people live in the world and relate to God has never been the same since. 

What might happen in our lives if we too put our trust and faith in the one who reaches out to us in love?

2021/01/03, 13:30 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily Epiphany – B, 2021 - Fr Jerry Browne

Gordon Wilson’s daughter was killed by a bomb in Enniskillen on Remembrance Day in 1987. Instead of calling for revenge, he forgave her killers and began a campaign for peace and reconciliation.
He said: “I am a very ordinary sort of man. I have few personal ambitions and no political aspirations. I just want to live and let live. Life has been kind to me in the main, and I have tried to live by the Good Book. I do not profess to be a good man, but I aim to be. I would like to leave the world a better place than I found it, but I have no exaggerated ideas of my ability to do so. I have hitched my wagon to a star, a star of hope, the star of Bethlehem.

The hope that Wilson speaks of is shown forth in today’s feast of the epiphany, when our scriptures help us to understand that Christ is the manifestation of God in the flesh - that God is to be found in the most surprising of places, at times in the darkness, at times in the pain and the grief of our lives, at times in the stranger, at times in the joy of family, but always in the moment we least expect.
In the first reading (Isaiah 60:1-6), Isaiah boldly predicts the restoration and renewal of Jerusalem even as it lies in ruin. He reminds people of God’s faithfulness and encourages them to hang in there, even when all they can see is darkness, uncertainty and chaos. God will not abandon his people.

The Gospel story (Matthew 2:1-12) is a similar story of faith, where the Magi trust the prompting of the spirit, much like Abraham and Sarah before them, and embark on a journey beyond the security and familiarity of their surroundings.

They leave their home, their family, their place of comfort, and find themselves in a situation that is unfamiliar, scary, pilgrims in a strange land.

As they journey, they discover that the one they are seeking is not found in the place that they expected - a royal house amidst the powerful and the wealthy – but rather is found in the midst of poverty and hardship.

It is a challenging reminder to us that perhaps the ‘god’ we have fashioned in the comfort of lives is, in truth, no more than an effigy of ourselves. And that it is only when we find ourselves stripped of all that we have so valued that we come to know who God really is. 

Epiphany, then, is a moment of divine surprise, a moment when preconceived ideas are shattered and we come to know God in a way that breaks through all the personal, social and cultural layers that have served to justify our current worldview.

It is a moment when we see life differently, and for a while are left vulnerable and  exposed as our minds let go of the limitations we had imposed on God and we learn to live with a new reality. That can be a scary place. And it certainly isn’t easy. But it is also a place of extraordinary growth where we begin to discover God’s plan for our lives.  It is often a moment when our life changes direction.

In the gospel we hear, how, after having encountered the Christ child, the Magi “returned home by another way.” There’s a little play on words here. Remember Jesus said “I am the way, the truth and the life…” Followers of Jesus were known as followers of the way. Matthew wants us to see that once we encounter Jesus, life will not be the same again.

The old “way” of doings things no longer works. We need to follow a new path – to follow the new way – the way of Jesus himself.
 
Gordon Wilson, the father of the young girl who was killed in Enniskillen, chose to follow the way of Christ when he chose the path of forgiveness rather than revenge.

The way of Christ is not necessarily the easiest way, but it is the way that leads to life.

It challenges us to let go of our old ways of thinking and acting, and asks us to be prepared to abandon our prejudices and discomforts and make the choice to live from a place of love and hope knowing that God’s power has broken into the world through Christ our Lord.
 
Epiphany teaches us something else, too – and that is to not be discouraged by the darkness. There may well be times when, just like the Magi, we feel lost. It is at those time that we need remember that it is often when the night seems deepest and the journey seems longest that the light breaks through.  

So, this Epiphany, let us look for how God is making Himself known in our lives – and follow the light. Because as the magi learned, even though the light is not always easy to find, when we do find it it will always take us where we are meant to go – to the source of all light, the source of all hope.

Let us pray this day for the gift of the Holy Spirit, for the strength and courage we need to never give up the search.

- Often our natural human tendency is to worry and be anxious.
- In the days in which we live, there seems so much to be concerned about.
- But the Lord wants us to experience His peace as we trust Him.
- It is in enjoying the perpetual presence of God, that we can know His peace.

2021/01/17, 15:05 - +27 82 851 5315: Second Sunday – Year B – 2021 – Fr Jerry Browne

Jesus asks a great question at the beginning of today’s Gospel (John 2:35-42). Turning to two of John the Baptist’s disciples - who have decided to follow Jesus - he asks a fairly fundamental question “What are you looking for?” That is a great question!  What are you looking for? Right now, how would you answer that question?

In some way the answer to the question is as varied as the people who hear the question. At times it may be very practical – I am looking for a job, I am looking for stability, I want a house, a family – a husband or a wife! I want health and security. I am looking for peace of mind.  At other times it can be more complex, when we find ourself grappling with questions about the meaning of life and the purpose of our existence? 

What if you already have the house and the car and the family - and all the rest of it - and there is still something missing? What are you looking for then?

Or, what happen when your world falls apart, when, in the midst of a pandemic, or in the day-to-day stuff of life, suddenly everything collapses and you are left with illness and  death, or you are faced with questions that you thought would never be yours – what then - what  happens when everything that you have relied upon suddenly seems to be stripped away – how would you answer Jesus then? 

Maybe you will say that your need someone to hold you; someone to accept you and those you love; someone to reassure you and understand you and still love you in spite of all the questions that you might have.

Andrew and his fellow seeker must have had similar questions, and an unrest that compelled them to look to Jesus for an answer. What is significant in Jesus’ response is not his preaching but in his invitation to the seekers to “come and see.”  

Could it be that even in the complexity of life that the fundamental answer to our deepest questions is not to be found in our philosophical, theological, social or pastoral responses, but in the way that we reach out to each other in love – in the way that we meet people where they are, and accept them and love then where we find them, and not where we might want them to be?

There is a story told about Saint Francis of Assisi, about how one day he invited one of the young friars to join him on a trip into town where he was going to preach the gospel. The young friar was so honoured at receiving such an invitation from St. Francis that he quickly accepted. As they made their way to town, they stopped for a moment beneath a tree where Francis noticed a young bird that had fallen from its nest. Before moving along he carefully returned the chick to safety.

Later on their journey, they stopped at a field where farmers were working and helped them to load hay onto a cart. From there they went to the town square where Francis lifted a bucket of water from the well for an old woman and carried it to her house. All day long the young man and Francis walked through the streets and the lanes helping whoever was in need. Each time they stopped, the young friar was sure that Francis would take the opportunity to preach the gospel. But no words of great truth or spiritual wisdom came from the saint’s mouth. Finally, they went into the Church, where Francis knelt and prayed in silence. At the end of the day, the two headed back home. Not once had Francis addressed a crowd, nor had he talked to anyone about the Gospel. The young monk was greatly disappointed, and eventually said to Francis, “I thought we were going into town to preach?” Francis responded, “My son, we have preached! We were preaching while we were walking and in everything we did. We were seen by many and our behaviour was closely watched. It’s of no use to walk anywhere to preach unless we preach everywhere as we walk!”

It is clear from the way that Francis lived his day to day life that he had come to know Jesus, that he had come to realise that love cannot be wrapped in a word, if it is not first offered with acceptance and respect. When Jesus says “come and see” he is not inviting us to see things as they have always been – measured according to the norms and rules of society – rather he is inviting us to try a new way, a way that puts unconditional love at the forefront of every relationship.

This takes courage, because it asks us to let go of limited thinking and put the welfare of the person who stands before us, first. It asks us to let go of self interest in favour of acceptance. It asks us to let go of self-preservation in favour of justice and insists on the value of the other as much as we value ourselves. 

“Come and see’ is an invitation to a new way of living that is rooted in practical love – the kind of love that meets us where we are and loves us first – and then is prepared to journey with us as we figure out who we are truly meant to be or as we grapple with the questions that trouble our minds.

So this morning let us pray that we might have the courage to live our discipleship without counting the costs - following the example and teaching of Jesus, so that others too can know the gift of God’s love in their lives.

2021/01/24, 14:17 - +27 82 851 5315: Third Sunday – Year B – 2021 – Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told about a young Russian who had become a conscientious objector to war because of his faith. He was brought before a magistrate to defend his stance. Bravely he told the judge that he believed in a way of life in which we must love our enemies; in a life that does good even if the good is not returned; in a life that seeks to overcome evil and refuses war. The Judge responded that he understood these sentiments but that the young man must be realistic – that these laws he was talking about were the laws of the Kingdom of God, and it has not come yet. The young man stood up straight and said, “Sir, I recognize it has not come for you, or for many in the world. But the Kingdom of God has come for me! I can’t go on hating and killing as though it had not come.”

Once we have experienced God’s love, our life can never be the same again. It is as if we can see with new eyes and we suddenly become aware of how our thoughts and actions have not always brought life, but have contributed to the pain and destruction of the world. This moment of clarity helps us to see different possibilities and can be a moment of conversion, what the church calls metanoia or repentance. Genuine repentance is not so much about guilt or shame but has more to do with sorrow and regret about the harmful effects of our thoughts and actions, and includes a genuine commitment to change the direction of our lives.

So when Jesus announces that “the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel” he is essentially calling people to a radically different way of living. He is asking us to open our hearts and minds to a new way of seeing each other, and to a new way of seeing God. He is asking us to examine some of the assumptions and norms that we have come to accept and to unmask the biases and prejudices that have come to shape our lives. This can be a lonely road, and can at times mean that we have to abandon long held family and societal traditions that are in conflict with the gospel.  But that is what answering the call means. That’s what it means to put Christ first in out lives.

We see this symbolically represented in today’s Gospel (Mark 1:14-20) when the disciples leave their family, their boat and their nets. We see something similar in John’s gospel, when the Samaritan woman at the well, leaves her water jar and goes to tell the townspeople about her encounter with Christ. It is as if the scriptures are telling us that we can’t live in two worlds - we have to make a choice. If we are going to respond to the call of Christ then there may be people and attitudes that we need to walk away from, outlooks that we need to re-examine and actions that need to change.

This is hard work, and it can be even more difficult for good people. People who are living decent lives, who don’t really do anything really bad. People like you and me who go to church on a regular basis and who do our best to help the poor.  And yet if we scratch the surface maybe we come face-to-face with some of our own prejudices, like Jonah whom we met in our first reading today. (Jonan 3:1-5,10).

Jonah was a man of God - but when God asked him to visit the people of Nineveh, he’s prejudice came out. Jonah like many of his countrymen despised the Ninevites. The Ninevites were notorious for their lack of morals and their idolatrous, decadent lifestyle. Jonah would have been more than happy to see them destroyed. So when God asks him to go and preach a message of repentance, Jonah runs in the opposite direction.

It takes real honesty in our self-reflection to recognise the bias that lives just under the surface in our life. We have to look deeply at ourselves in the light of the gospel, and in the light of God’s love to see what is really going on and to see what we might do differently. Deep down we know that we are not yet the people that God is calling us to be. Only in Christ can we see what we can become, wonderful, beautiful, people made in the image of God, loved and lovable.

So today, as we gather here, how are we prepared to answer the call of God in our life? Are we like the young Russian, so convinced about the gospel that we are willing to give witness to another way of life; to make a personal choice that challenges the prevailing mindset of society? Or are we still a work in progress? The good news is that God’s loving mercy is available to all, whoever we are, wherever we live, whatever we have done in the past, and wherever we are on our journey. By choosing to open ourselves to Christ and by letting go of those parts of our life that do not bring life, we can share in the fulness of life here and now. And so the choice is ours. How will we respond? Jesus calls us to this radical way of life. Come, follow me! How will you respond, and how will your life reflect that response?

2021/01/31, 21:16 - +27 82 851 5315: Fourth Sunday in Ordinary Time – Year B – 2021- Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told about a teacher who noticed that one of her students, a quiet young girl, was having some difficulty with one of her Math questions. The teacher went to the child discreetly and asked if she could help with the question knowing the girl was shy about asking for help.  When the problem was solved the little girl thanked the teacher. The teacher told the little girl not to be shy about asking questions, "That's one of the reasons I am here." The little girl thought about that for a moment and then asked quietly, "What's the other reason?" I thought that that was a good question. Often we seem to just use words, or read words, without really thinking about what they mean. Maybe the evangelist Mark was aware of this and so looks for other ways to help people come to know who Jesus is, and what his ministry is about.

In today’s gospel we hear how Jesus arrives in Capernaum, enters the temple and teaches with authority. Mark tells this story at the beginning of Jesus’ public ministry, just after the calling of the disciples. Surprisingly however, he doesn’t tell us what Jesus teaches. So what going on?

Remember when Jesus first began preaching he declared “the Kingdom of God is at hand, repent, and believe in the gospel.” This becomes a key theme throughout Jesus’ life and ministry, so it is safe to assume that this teaching had something to do with the Kingdom of God, but Marks wants us to understand that the kingdom isn’t only about some future reality, but about the here and now.
Let’s take a look at the story itself. There are two things that stand out. First of all, the story take place on the Sabbath - a day of tremendous significance for the Jewish people. For a people who had been enslaved in Egypt and were forced to work daily without rest, the restoration of the ‘sabbath’ (meaning to rest from labour), (Exodus 16:23), was, at a practical level, a constant reminder of their liberation from slavery. At a spiritual level the sabbath was an acknowledgment of the greatness of God, who created the universe and provided for humanity’s every need. Keeping it holy, refraining from all unnecessary activity, was an affirmation of the people’s desire to live holy lives and so give honour to God. One of the problems that had arisen however, is that the leaders of the people had imposed so many rules and regulations regarding what could and could not be done on the sabbath, that the laws themselves began to enslave people.

That brings us to the second point in the story. In the midst of Jesus’ teaching, a man with an unclean spirit cries out. Imagine how startled the congregation must have been! What will Jesus do? Ignore the man in order to observe the sabbath law, or reach out in compassion to free him from his bondage. Jesus ‘breaks’ the sabbath law and in doing so liberates not only the man who was possessed by an unclean spirit, but the many onlookers who had, themselves, been held captive in other ways - maybe to laws and rituals that they had blindly gone along with; or to an image of a God that inspired fear rather than love; or to an understanding of a person’s worth that was based on some societal practice rather than on the dignity and integrity of the person.

In presenting this episode at the beginning of his Gospel Mark is suggesting that the “Kingdom of God” that Jesus preaches is more than just mere words, but is a moment of real liberation, an incarnational moment, where God reaches into our lives and frees us from whatever it is that enslaves us. Mark doesn’t tell us about the authoritative teaching of Jesus, rather he wants us to watch what he does. He wants us to see Jesus liberate people from their bondage, visit people in their illness, touch people in their brokenness  and welcome people in their isolation. He wants us to see in Jesus the inbreaking presence of God in our lives, and to know that through him, we too will be set free to be who we were meant to be.  

But there is more, there is a second reason that Mark wants us to see Jesus at work. It is a reminder to us that our liberation alone is not enough. We cannot be truly free while others are in bondage. As members of Christ’s body, it is not enough to pray from a distance. Rather, we are invited to share in the mission and ministry of Jesus to help enhance the lives of those who cross our path. To engage people and their concerns; to champion the cause of those in need; to make a positive difference in the lives of the people we live and work with; to help restore the dignity of someone who has lost their sense of self-worth; to lift us the downtrodden - and to look for the many other ways that we can help our brother or sister, because in so doing we honour God, we help bring about the kingdom of God here and now.

So today as we gather to hear, as we listen to God’s word, where might the spirit be leading us? Do we need to go beyond mere words, to enter more fully into the life of God in the way that we reach out to one another, in the way that help one another, in the way that we lift each other up? It is then, in those practical ways that the word becomes flesh, and that we give witness to God’s reign here and now and help transform the world  into the world that God desires it to be.

2021/02/07, 12:38 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Fifth Sunday - B - 2021- Fr Jerry Browne

In the course of this past year, we have all either experienced, or heard stories of, great pain and suffering as we have witnessed the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic unfold. There is the suffering of sickness, death and grief caused by the virus itself, and the suffering caused by social isolation or the pain and devastation of domestic abuse which has escalated as people are forced to stay home with their abusers.

Added to this sadness is the grief, hardship and suffering that visits so many families through illness, job-losses and poverty – the normal stuff that happens in our life, over and above the coronavirus. It is easy to find ourselves questioning where God is in all of this – or asking why God allows such suffering? Or maybe even wondering if this is some kind of punishment from God! It is difficult to understand why people suffer or have to carry such heavy burdens. Why does it have to be like this? Sometime these experiences undermine our confidence in a loving God, and even at times, leave us questioning God’s very existence, and if he does, how can this be? These are not new questions meant for our time alone, but questions that people have been struggling with from the beginning of time.

In our first reading today, from the book of Job (Job 7:1-4, 6-7), we hear this question play out as Job attempts to make sense of his suffering. Theologians and scripture scholars agree that the book of Job is not an historical account of a particular event, or a particular person, like Job, rather it is a spiritual reflection on the reality of suffering – something that is part of our human existence. Job, a good living man, finds himself in the most awful situation. He loses everything, his family, his possessions, his wealth, even the respect of his friends. Not only that, but can you Imagine his desolation when even his wife joins the chorus of people questioning Job’s loyalty to God urging him instead to curse God and die. (Job 2:9). She has given up hope that there can ever be a God with all of this misery in the world, and in Job’s life. For all his deliberations as to why suffering has visited his door, Job doesn’t come up with any convincing answers. But somehow in the midst of it all he hangs in there – because he knows that God is a faithful God – even in the midst of his suffering. The truth is that there is no easy answer. Suffering is part of life; it is part of our human condition. It is not caused by God, as if God chooses to inflict punishment on us for no apparent reason, but it is real nonetheless and can leave us wondering if God has in fact abandoned us.  
 
In contrast to Job’s story, we meet Jesus in the gospel (Mark 1:29-38) on his way to the house of Simon’s mother-in-law. The mother-in-law is sick, so Jesus reaches out to her and raises her up. Mark uses the same word here ‘to raise up’ as he does when he speaks about the resurrection. In other word’s Mark wants us to understand that Jesus’ mission is one that overturns this notion that illness and suffering are caused by God – a notion that was very prevalent in Old Testament times. Many believed that if you were sick, or that if there was suffering in your life that somehow it was a punishment from God. Mark wants us to know that instead of that understanding of God, that in fact God enters into our pain and suffering to bring life and hope – to help us through it all.
 
We see this in Jesus’ life and ministry. The gospel tells us that he spent his time alleviating pain and suffering, that the people brought to him all who were ill or possessed by demons, in fact that the whole town gathered at his door, and that he cured many who were sick with various disease and drove out many demons. In other words, Mark wants us to know that in Jesus we meet a God who heals the sick and makes people whole again. In Jesus we see God’s definitive answer to the recurring question that emerges whenever we find ourselves in despair. And that is that we are not alone. God, in Jesus has joined his life to ours in a way that we can understand – that is what the incarnation is about – that God became human – and that in Jesus, God entered into the suffering of our human existence. God is saying to us that we are loved and that he has chosen to be with us in a more personal way. He journeys with us on the road of hardship and guides us once more into the light.
 
There is no doubt that there will still be many times when we experience suffering in our life, sometimes through circumstances beyond our control – when a loved one falls ill or dies - and sometimes by the decisions we make ourselves – the choices we make in our life can at times bring suffering. We may be left feeling abandoned and alone, trapped in a place of darkness that seems as if it will never lift. It is at times like that that we need to remember that no matter what has happened - or what will happen, we will always be loved by God, and we will never be truly alone, because right there in the darkness – God is with us - the one who brought us into life is with us – even if it seems as if we are alone. And if you every forget, that God is there in the midst of your despair - just place your fingers on the inside of your wrist, or your hand on your heart and wait to feel your heartbeat – that pulse is God saying to you I am still with you – that I am here. God is the animator of life – God is the one that hold us in existence, and your heart beat is God’s way of saying to you that he is still here.
 
And just as Jesus’ love healed Simon’s mother-in-law, so it can heal you, help you, cure you, redeem you, save you. Because that is God’s deepest desire for you.

So today, as we gather here, take a moment and ask yourself what is God saying to me through these scriptures? Is he reaching out to you once again to remind you perhaps that you are not alone, that he is right here with you in your day to day living? Maybe he is asking you to trust, to hope, to believe! As you place your hand on your heart, listen to him say, I love you. 

Put your hand on your heart right now. Listen to God saying to you - I love you, I care for you, you are precious, you are mine!

2021/02/14, 14:09 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Sixth Sunday - B - 2021- Fr Jerry Browne
 
It is said that during the Second World War some soldiers serving in France wanted to bury a friend and fellow soldier who had been killed. Being in a foreign country they wanted to ensure their fallen comrade had a proper burial. They found a well-kept cemetery next to a Catholic church, with a low fence around it. This was just the place to bury their friend. But when they approached the priest, he answered that unless their friend was a baptised Catholic, he could not be buried in the cemetery. He wasn’t.
 
Sensing the soldier’s disappointment, the priest showed them a spot outside the fence where they could bury their friend. Reluctantly they did so. A few days later the soldiers returned to pay their final respects to their fallen friend but could not find the grave. “Surely we can’t be mistaken” they said to one another "It was right here!” Confused, they approached the priest who took them to a spot inside the cemetery fence. “After the burial", said the priest, "I couldn’t sleep. I was troubled that your friend had to be buried outside the cemetery, so I got up and moved the fence.”
 
How often we use religious or cultural rules and regulations to define our differences - to keep us separated. We are more concerned about maintaining the status quo than we are about the person who is being excluded. Isolation, rejection, been cut off, not belonging, these are all painful experiences in anyone’s life. Not fitting in because of religious or cultural difference, because of lifestyle or age, or because of illness or some physical incapability, can leave us feeling vulnerable and alone. It undermines our self-confidence and leaves us questioning the value of our lives.
 
Today’s gospel tackles the question of separation, isolation and division as we reflect on the story of the leper who had to live outside the camp - who was forced to isolated from other people. In the case of the leper there was a rather obvious medical reason for the isolation – people saw his physical affliction and were fearful that they might be contaminated too, so they excluded him from the group – shunned him and cast him out.
 
But the reality is that all too often, segregation and isolation are driven by social and cultural conventions like prejudice, race, self-preservation, or a superior attitude that denigrates those who are different from us. In a real sense we force people to live outside the camp all the time – because, we believe, in one way or another that they don’t fit in, that we are better than they are, or that there is something about their lifestyle that makes them unacceptable. If you ever find yourself talking about “them” or saying things like “they always …” it is a sure sign that you have taken sides – and the ‘they’ you are referring to are most definitely outside your camp.
 
In our first reading from the book of Leviticus, (13:1-2. 44-46), we see how the word of God prescribed the isolation of the leper for medical reasons - but in the Gospel (Mark 1:40-45) we see Jesus reaching out and touching the leper. As such this story is not only about healing a disease but is also a statement of Jesus’ desire to restore the man’s dignity and bring him back into the heart of the community. It is about restoring relationships and a reminder that any divisions that undermine the dignity of another is not from God - even when we think we are doing it for a good reason or valid reason.
 
By reaching out and touching the leper, Jesus breaks with convention. In so doing, he not only acts in a way that was different from his contemporaries, but he also risked becoming “unclean” Himself in order to make the leper clean. As it turns out, his actions came at a cost. The gospel makes the point that following this incident that Jesus “had to stay outside in places where nobody lived”. In other words, that he was willing to trade places with the leper, with us, in order that we might know the fulness of God’s love. His actions, in a way, are a parable about the story of salvation – how God reaches into our lives to bring us healing, not only physical healing, but a healing that restores our dignity, a healing that overcomes division and restores unity, that restores our relationship with God and one another, and helps us to live in harmony with God, ourselves and one another.
 
The story about the leper is not an isolated incident in Jesus ministry. Time and again we see him reach out to the margins of society and bring people to the centre. He sits and eats with people who are considered sinners, he befriends the poor and the desolate, the ‘no bodies’ of life, and he promises them a place in the kingdom. If we recognise Jesus as the human face of God, then this gospel story reminds us that we cannot be disciples of Jesus and fail to address injustices against our brothers and sisters who are poor, vulnerable or deprived. As missionary disciples, people who share in Jesus’ mission and ministry, we are called to be bridge builders, to speak out courageously in the face of injustice and to reach out physically to those in need, to break the barriers that serve only to divide us so that we might affirms the humanity of those we meet. Such actions won’t be easily accepted, because they call for a reordering of society, a questioning of the way ‘things have always been’. Like Jesus, we may well end up outside the camp - but that’s okay, because we will meet Jesus there.

2021/02/21, 14:19 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 1st Sunday of Lent - B - 2021- Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told about a young couple who were struggling to make ends meet. One day the husband came home from work and found that his wife had bought an extremely expensive dress. When he asked her how she could spend so much money on a dress, when she knew that they couldn’t afford it, she said that one minute she was outside the shop looking at the dress in the window, and the next she found herself in the shop trying it on. She said it was like Satan whispered in my ear, “You’ll look fabulous in that dress. Buy it!” “Well,” said the husband, “you know how I deal with that kind of temptation. I say, “Get behind me Satan!” His wife replied, “I did that, but then he said, “It looks fabulous from the back too!”

Temptations are part of our life and usually aim to exploit a weakness or a vulnerability with promises that our life will be enhanced if only we have this one thing… or wear this piece of clothing … or drive this car … or have this title … or …

Every year on the First Sunday of Lent the readings tell the story of Jesus’ temptation in the desert. Following his Baptism in the Jordan, Jesus is led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness where he his confronted by Satan. In order to better understand the gospel, we need to look at chapter three of the book of Genesis. There we hear the story of the Fall - how Satan tempted Adam and Eve, and how they gave into the temptation - going against God’s wishes for them. The chapter ends with Adam being expelled from the garden - and two angels are placed at the entrance to prevent his return. It is a story of a fractured relationship, a story of humanities rejection of God’s plan for us, a story of unfulfilled promises and a story that outlines the consequences of trying to live without God.

When Mark tells the story of Jesus’ temptations in the desert, he wants us to see that Jesus is the new Adam, the second Adam. Like the first Adam, Jesus was tempted by Satan, but he remained faithful to God. In making this connection, Mark wants us to see Jesus as the beginning of a new creation – a new way of being in relationship with God and one another. He is the one who heals our fractured relationship with God, and the only one that we can truly trust.

As soon as Jesus leaves the desert, we hear him announce that the time has come, that the kingdom of God is close at hand - repent and believe the good news. In other words, he is telling us that it is time to re-focus our lives, to turn away from sin and to put God at the centre. The Kingdom of God announced by Jesus is essentially an invitation to submit our lives to God’s loving guidance, to allow God’s will to animate our lives as we strive to live with love in our hearts. There is nothing else, and no one else that will satisfy the longing within us – only God.
It is through our baptism that we get to share in this new life with God, that we choose to be part of God’s plan of salvation for the world. Of course, the fact that we are baptised won’t protect us from temptations of one kind or another – it simply reminds us that we are loved deeply by God – something that makes all the difference when we are faced with difficult choices in our life. We see this when Jesus is tempted in the desert.

Prior to his desert experience, Mark recalls the story of Jesus’ baptism where we hear Jesus described as ‘beloved’. There is no doubt that knowing that we are loved empowers us and strengthens us in a way that nothing else can. When we are secure in ourselves, we don’t need the promises of power or wealth or position to give us a sense of importance or self-worth. These external things can never accomplish what they promise, rather they leave us feeling even more empty when they don’t deliver.
As we begin our Lenten journey could it be that we are not being invited to focus on the temptations that we grapple with, but rather on the vulnerability that lies beneath – the vulnerability that the temptations promise to fix or overcome. All of us struggle, all of us are vulnerable, all of us need to hear the words that we are ‘beloved’, but more importantly we need to believe; to believe that we are okay; to believe that we have value in spite of our darkness; to believe that we are loved and that there is a place for us in God’s kingdom.

So what might the Holy Spirit be asking of you today? To take time to reflect on how much you are loved by God? To pray for the grace of self-acceptance? Or to open yourself to the promise of God - that you are loved for who you are – that you too are beloved?

2021/02/28, 13:48 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 2nd Sunday Lent - B - 2021

Someone once said that there are only two kinds of people in the world, those who are there when you need them and those who aren’t. Abraham was one of those people who was there when God needed him. When God called, he responded ‘here I am’. When God asked him to leave his homeland and family and go to a strange land, he went. When God asked him to sacrifice the one he loved the most, Abraham was even willing to do that (Genesis 22:1-2, 9a, 10-13, 15-18).

His life is an amazing story of faith and obedience. No matter what, he was ready to trust God. He was ready to do whatever God asked. What amazing faith. What an incredible level of trust!
How willing are we to trust God’s call in our life? How willing are we to follow the prompting of the Holy Spirit in out lives? How willing are we to step out of our comfortable ways, to grow, to change, to let go of whatever it is that prevents us from saying ‘here I am Lord’, in our day to day lives!

Lent is a time when we are invited to take stock of our lives, to look again at what we need to do differently. There is a story told by Anthony De Mello about how an old man’s prayer life had changed as he got older. When he was young the man was a revolutionary and his prayer to God was ‘Lord, give me the grace to change the world.’ When the man approached middle age and realized that half of his life was gone without changing a single soul, he changed his prayer to: ‘Lord, give me the grace to change all those who come in contact with me; just my family and friends and I will be satisfied.’ When he reached old age and realised that his days were numbered, he began to see how foolish he had been and realised that he had to change his prayer again. Now his one prayer is: ’Lord, give me the grace to change myself.’  In his old age the man recalled ‘If I had prayed for this right from the start, how different my life might be.’

In this season of prayer and reflection, maybe we also need to be more willing to open ourselves to God’s plan for our lives? God’s plan for us doesn’t always meant that the road we take will be easy. In fact, there are times when we may have to make almost impossible decisions. Imagine the dilemma that Abraham found himself in when he was asked to sacrifice his son. He had waited many years to have an heir, and only in his old age was his prayer answered and now he seemed certain that God was asking him to offer his son as a sacrifice – and yet he was willing to trust God.

In the gospel we hear the story of the transfiguration (Mk 9:2-10), which ends with an affirmation that Jesus is God’s beloved son. It is an extraordinary moment when the disciples are instructed to ‘listen to him.’ But listen to what? To everything that Jesus ever said! Of course we must do that, but what if this instruction has to do with what Jesus has just said prior to the mountain top experience? In the text just prior to the story of the transfiguration, Jesus predicts his own death. Peter found that hard to deal with, and so remonstrates with Jesus. It is then that Jesus says to Peter, ‘Get behind me Satan” and goes on to say ‘If any want to be my followers, then let them deny themselves and take up their cross ... and follow me.’ (Mark 8:35ff).
In other words, Jesus is making it very clear that choosing to live a life of faith, choosing to follow him, is not going to be easy. It’s all fairly daunting, and in a way, doesn’t look very attractive. So when Jesus invited Peter, James and John to join him on the mountain, he wasn’t inviting them to go along with him for the hike, but was rather offering them some encouragement, a glimpse of what lies ahead for him, and them, when they put their trust in God. As such, the transfiguration is a glimpse into the future and a moment of encouragement for all who are counting the cost of discipleship.  

In offering everything to the Father, Jesus secures new life for all who choose to share their life with him. In a way that is what faith is about. It is when we forfeit control of our lives, when we finally let go and allow God to be our guide. As we slowly let go our desire to control, our need to lord it over others and our need to be in charge of every aspect of our lives, we gradually come to recognise the beauty of God’s plan for the world. We begin to see the dignity of the people around us, no longer seeing them as opponents to be conquered, but as fellow travellers on the road of life who are to be loved and supported.

Listening to Jesus is about hearing, through him, God’s deepest desire for our life. It is about allowing ourselves to be shaped and transformed by his life and teaching, so than in turn our lives can help others to come to know the intimate love of God.

So today, as we Listen to Him, what are the scriptures asking of us? To trust with Abraham that all will be well and that God will not lead us to a place we shouldn’t be? To be of service to others, like Christ, giving of ourselves in a way that brings others to God? As we continue our Lenten journey let us pray for the grace and courage that we need to allow God’s love to fill us and for the openness and willingness to live that love in the world.

2021/03/14, 13:54 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 4th Sunday of Lent - B - 2021- Fr Jerry Browne

John Rankin was a presbyterian minister who, back in the 1800’s, lived in a small town called Ripley, on the banks of the Ohio River. John’s house was located on a hill close to the river. It is said that every night the Rankin family would place a lantern or candle in the front window to guide runaway slaves from across the Ohio River. The candle was a signal for the runaway slaves, a beacon of hope on a journey that was fraught with danger, a light guiding them in the darkness to a place of hospitality and safety that offered shelter, rest and temporary refuge on their journey north to freedom. 

All of us need people like John Rankin in our life, people who will guide us and help in our moment of need. Sometimes that person can be a parent or a friend, a mentor or a teacher, a husband or a wife, a priest or someone who has our best interest at heart. Ultimately of course, as our gospel today (John 3:14-21) reminds us, that person is Jesus. He is our light! He is the one who reveals to us the fullness of God’s love. He is the one who shows us how to live in right relationship with God, ourselves, the people around us and the world we live in. 

In the text we have just heard, Jesus is having a conversation with Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a pharisee and a leader of the Jews. Like so many others who listened to Jesus, he was fascinated by what Jesus said and did. He arranges to meet Jesus at night, so as not to attract undue attention. It is interesting that the evangelists mentions the detail about meeting at night. He often uses the imagery of night and day, darkness and light, in a symbolic way to depict those who have come to know Jesus, the light of the world, and who have subsequently made the choice to put their faith and trust in him, in contrast to those who are still in the darkness. Nicodemus recognise that there is something special about Jesus, but he hasn’t yet made the commitment to follow him. Jesus doesn’t dismiss Nicodemus, or belittle him for his lack of faith, or ridicule his fear, but instead offers him a message of hope and love. It is not Israel’s strict adherence to the ancient Law but the love of God that is the vehicle of salvation. God is motivated by a love so great that he gives the world his only Son, not to condemn the world, or destroy it or hurt those who have turned away from him, but to transform the world so that we might be saved. Redemption begins with God; reconciliation and healing are God’s work, filled with possibilities that are as limitless as they are undeserved. 

Despite humanity’s unfaithfulness, which we heard about in our first reading today from the book of Chronicles (2 Chronicles 36:14-15, 19-23) where “the princes of Judah, the priests, and the people added infidelity to infidelity, practicing all the abominations of the nations”  and which we ourselves witness daily in our own time - crime, corruption, rape, murder, theft, deceit, greed, unfaithfulness – all in a country where 80% of us proclaim to be Christian - despite all these things, God remains faithful and continues to reach out to us in love. 

What an incredible lesson for our lives! That love should be the foundation of everything. In other words when something happens in our lives, when someone hurts us, when someone lets us down, when someone betrays our friendship or when someone offends us, we are called to respond with love - not to retaliate, not to seek revenge, not to try and “get even”, not to trade insult for insult, but to reach out to the other in love. 

Like Nicodemus and like the runaway slaves, there are times in our life when we need someone to show us the way. When we find ourselves in our darkest moments, when we have lost direction in our life; when we find ourselves drifting to a place of hopelessness; when we are afraid that our sin, our darkness, is going to swallow us up. It is then that we need to remember the promise of Jesus. In his questioning and confusion, his fears and doubts, Nicodemus is welcomed by Jesus with understanding and compassion. God so loves us that, by his grace, he takes our darkness and changes it into light; in his wisdom, he transfigures our despair into joy; in his compassion, he heals our broken hearts and spirits and makes them whole again.

So today, as we listen to this word of God, what might the Holy Spirit be saying to us? Is there a possibility that we, life Nicodemus, are fascinated with Jesus, but haven’t made the commitment to truly give our lives to him yet? Are we still, somehow, in the darkness? Or maybe there is a place in our life that we need to invite the light and love of Christ, something perhaps that needs to be healed, to free us to be who we are meant to be? Or maybe, just maybe, we are being called to be a John Rankin, to be a light, to be Christ for someone else, to accept someone, to forgive someone, to love someone, unconditionally.  

Wherever the Spirit might be calling us, let us pray for the grace and the courage to say ‘yes’, to open our minds and hearts to God’s love, so that in turn we can be that love and so transform the world, making it the place that God truly desires it to be.

‘His faith did not leave him, and he (Abraham) did not doubt God's promise.’

- We must never allow doubt and unbelief to rob us of our confidence in God.
- Doubt and unbelief will cause us to stagger, stumble and fall.
- God’s promise to Abraham was great and by all means an impossibility.
- Abraham held on by faith because he knew how great and faithful God was.

2021/03/21, 13:03 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 5th Sunday of Lent - B - 2021 - Fr Jerry Browne

In 1996 Cardinal Bernadine of Chicago wrote a book about his life and his impending death. A short time before that, he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and knew that the end was coming. He finished the book just 13 days before he died.

The book is entitled Gift of Peace and speaks about the Cardinal's spiritual journey as he coped with a litany of traumatic events in his life: there had been a false accusation of sexual abuse, followed by reconciliation with the accuser who recanted the charges; then he got cancer and had to deal with the surgery that ensued; sometime later the cancer came back - this time in his liver, so he made the decision to discontinue chemotherapy and to live his remaining days as fully as possible.

In the book Bernardin tells his story openly and honestly and shares the profound peace he came to at the end of his life.  He saw the peace he experienced as a gift from God, as he came to realise that so much of the stuff that we worry about is meaningless when we measure it against the purpose of our existence. As he concludes the book he writes “What I would like to leave behind is a simple prayer that each of you may find what I have found - God's special gift to us all: the Gift of Peace.
When we are at peace, we find the freedom to be most fully who we are, even in the worst of times. We let go of what is nonessential and embrace what is essential. We empty ourselves so that God may more fully work within us. And we become instruments in the hands of the Lord."

It is so easy to get caught up in the busy-ness of life, worrying and fretting about little things. Our lives get clogged up with all kinds of distractions – stuff that seems hugely important at the time like our professional qualifications, or our position in society, or our bank balance, or the size of the house that we live in, or the kind of car that we drive, or the clothes we wear, or the way we look, or something else about our life that we think says something to those around us about who we are.

The reality of course is that all of these things, while offering temporary assurances of our value and worth, will ultimately be stripped away. What then? Bernadine would tell is that ultimately, all that matters is our relationship with God, trusting that his purpose for our life is the only thing that will give meaning.

In the gospel today (John 12:20-33) we hear how two Greeks who are visiting Jerusalem want to meet Jesus. Somehow, their request leads to an announcement by Jesus that his “hour has come.”
The enormity of this moment, and the realisation that ‘now’ was the time for him to put his faith into action, is a frightening reality for Jesus. He declares “I am troubled now. Yet what should I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’?

In this exchange we get to see the vulnerability and humanity of Jesus as he grapples with the possibility of what lies ahead.  It is a moment of reckoning, when the purpose of his life looms large – and he has to decide if he is willing to trust God’s plan for his life. In that moment of turmoil and fear Jesus lets go of everything as he turns to his Father and prays, “Father, glorify your name.” He is convinced that in spite of what lies ahead, that his Father will never abandon him. He puts his trust in him alone declaring in fact that we need die to self in order to be who God want us to be.

The message that Jesus shares with us, and that Cardinal Bernadine speaks about at the end of his life, is not only about physical death, but just as importantly it is about us creating space in our life right now for the life that God offers. Dying to self is about letting go of all the things that clog up our life, that prevents us from being truly free, trusting in God’s plan for us. It is about realising that sometimes the things we are clinging to, like the grudges we hold, the bitterness we harbour, the fears that we invest in, or the masks that we wear - the energy we use pretending to be someone we are not, all rob us of our freedom and prevent us from being the people God created us to be.

Over the years, I have been with many different people as they came to the end of their life. As they prepare to face death some were scared, others were somewhat ambivalent about death, and still others were totally at peace, even looking forward to ‘going home.’ They had lived and fulfilled their purpose in life. What will our response be when our day comes? Will we have lived the life we were meant to live? Will we have become the people that God desired us to be? Or is there something that we still need to do with our life? Is there something that we need to change? Because now is the time. This is our ‘hour’ to live the best life that we can.  

So today, as we gather here, let us take some time to reflect on what the Holy Spirit might be asking of our life today? Let us seize the day and make the changes that we need to make now – so that we don’t have any regrets when we face our final hour. Tomorrow may be too late! So what is your legacy going to be? A fulfilled life? A life that gives glory to God? Or is there still work to be done?

Today we celebrate the Passion and death of Jesus. In a way that is an unusual combination of words – celebrating – passion - death. And yet, it is in this act of supreme love that Jesus shows us what it is to be truly human - to be one with God and each other.
 
The story we have just heard (Mark 14:1-15:47) is full of pain and hurt, envy, betrayal and violence and might leave us wondering why God would allow such things to happen. Or why would anyone put themselves in the way of such abuse? Why would anyone be willing to put their life on the line? The only answer that helps us to make any sense of this extra-ordinary event is Love.
 
Today we celebrate the ultimate act of love. Jesus giving his life for us. It is an act of total commitment, an act of solidarity that Jesus lived daily throughout his earthly life and ministry. We see this in Jesus’ complete determination to do the fathers will; in his preference for the poor and abandoned; in his fury at the religious authorities who paid more attention to the law than to the people whom they were meant to help and guide; in his counter cultural attachment to those who were consigned to the margins of society; in his willingness to forgive the sinner and heal the broken. All of this speaks of a man who loved deeply, a man who was sure of himself, a man who had come to know the personal love of God and who understood that our role as human beings is to come to experience that love for ourselves and then to live as people of Love.
 
In a way, the cross comes as no surprise. It is THE sign of the lengths that love will go to in its passion for others. If we ever wondered if we are truly loved, all we need to do is look at the figure on the cross.
The cross stands at the centre of the Christian story as a sign of our worth. Somebody, Jesus, thought that we were worth all that pain and suffering and was willing to give his life for us.
 
So today, as we celebrate Passion Sunday, let us focus not on the violent act of crucifixion, but on the supreme act of love that Jesus was willing to make for our sake. In spite of our faults, failings, weaknesses and betrayals we are loved with a love that is bigger than them all. It is love such as this that offers redemption. It is love such as this offers the possibility of new life. It is love such as this that redeems us and helps us to become the people that God created us to be.
 
Let us take some time to contemplate the great gift of God’s love, to allow his love to touch us and heal us, so that we in turn can share his love with the world.

2021/04/02, 16:40 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - Good Friday - Cycle B, 2021

In his poem, Stop all the clocks, WH Auden captures in a graphic and powerful way the pain of loss, the tragedy of death and the sense that life will never be quite the same again. Often, in the moment of loss, we are plunged into a place of deep awareness and we suddenly realise how distracted we have been – how full of noise our lives can be – and how easily we let love slips away. The first verse and a half of the poem goes like this: “Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, / Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, / Silence the pianos and with muffled drum - bring out the coffin, let the mourners come. / Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead / Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead”

The poem echoes deeply with anyone who has experienced the pain of death and the loss of a loved one, capturing in some way the astonishment that life can still be carrying on for everyone else – as if nothing changed – while the person experiencing the loss can barely breathe - with grief, with the realisation that the one they loved has slipped away.

Today the church throughout the world enters into that place, that place of profound loss, of absence. There are no bells, no decorations – only an empty tabernacle and a bare altar. The vestments are red, a symbol of blood and martyrdom. This is the only day in the church calendar that Mass is not celebrated.

Just like in Auden’s poem, the church wants us to slow down, to reflect deeply on the tragedy of what has happened – to recognise how easily we can let love slip away, while we are distracted with other things - with the busy-ness of life.

For John the evangelist Jesus is the fullness of God’s love. Earlier in his gospel he writes: “For God loved the world so much that he gave his only Son, so that everyone who believes in him may not be lost but may have eternal life. For God sent his Son into the world not to condemn the world, but so that through him the world might be saved. (John 3:16)

For John, salvation comes when we learn the meaning of love again, when, with Jesus, we being to recognise all the distractions that cause us to lose our focus - to miss out on what is truly important - love.  In doing so we come to recognise the societal, and sometimes religious, constructs such as position, titles, power, wealth, level of education and even the neighbourhood that we live in, that rob us of our freedom, and leave us searching for meaning in things rather that in relationships.

Instead, Jesus reinforces the divine virtues of love and mercy, forgiveness and compassion, all aspect of healthy relationships that are rooted in our relationship with God. Of course, this world view is not always readily accepted and brings Jesus himself ridicule, rejection, persecution. In the face of such opposition - the bigotry, the hatred, the blindness, the violence, the institutional injustice, Jesus remains steadfast in his mission to bring new life to the world, to bring freedom, as he offers the gifts of love and forgiveness - even as they costs him his own life. In so doing, the world’s dysfunction is conquered, overcome by an even greater power - love.
In bringing the story of Jesus’ death to a close, John concludes with the words “it is finished,” The work of salvation is accomplished. In his total self-giving, Jesus has reconciled God and humanity. He has let go of everything so that we might have life. And maybe that is the crux of the matter. Unlike the first Adam who chose to trust in his own ability and power (symbolized in his decision to eat of the tree of knowledge) Jesus chooses to trust in God. That trust is rewarded in the resurrection. In the resurrection the door to eternal life is opened  to all. Humanity has been given a second chance – a new beginning. In the garden of Eden, a tree brought condemnation – now another tree brings about our redemption. On the cross - the tree of life - Jesus gave us everything he had. He gave us his love. He gave us his life. He gave us all that one person could give to another.

As we contemplate the cross this day, what does Jesus’ self-giving ask of our life? Is he asking me to reflect on how I put love, relationships, family and God before all else? Is he asking me to be mindful of the times when the distractions and busy-ness of my life, cause me to miss out on what is truly important - to let love slip away?  

As we take some time to contemplate the message of the cross, let us remember that in the end it is love that triumphs, it is love that gives life.

2021/04/04, 12:19 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Easter Sunday - Cycle B, 2021 - Fr Jerry Browne
 
All of us have moments of devastation in our life, times when our hopes and expectations are left in shatters. Like the elderly couple who received a phone call from their son who lives far away, to say that he is sorry, but the family won’t be able to visit this easter after all; or the woman who was called into her supervisor's office to hear that ‘times are hard for the company’ and that ‘we have to let you go’; or the family who got a phone call from the hospital to say that ‘we are sorry, but unfortunately dad didn’t pull through’; or the wife who heard the words "I don't love you anymore.” At such times we can feel the darkness descend and hope draining from our lives.
 
When we find ourselves in the darkness, it is easy to identity with the followers of Jesus who were shattered by his crucifixion and death. In today’s gospel (Mark 16:1-7) we meet the women on their way to the tomb, with spices to anoint the dead body of their friend. They had no expectation of new life, no hope of a resurrection – that would be beyond their comprehension - they simply went to do what was customary for the dead.  Imagine their surprise, their amazement when they found that Jesus was no longer there – and then to be told that ‘he had risen’!
 
The resurrection event changes everything. It is important to remember that the resurrection happened in the tomb – in the place of the dead. New life springs forth from the most unlikely of places. Ironically, it is only those who have been to the tomb, to that place where hope cannot be seen, that truly experience the resurrection. It is the last thing that we expect, and yet, one day, we are surprised to find that the light has come again, that we can laugh again, that we can hope again.
 
Jesus’ resurrection reminds us that God is always close at hand, that every Good Friday in our lives will eventually give way to an Easter Sunday. Every time we are defeated, we have the potential to triumph again, every time we fail, we can succeed again, every time we are broken, we can heal again, every time we are brought low, we can rise up again. In our moments of weakness, failure and loss it is easy to doubt ourselves, to lose faith in God, to be tempted to give up. It is important to remember that such moments have not come to stay, they have come to pass. Life follows death.
 
We celebrate Jesus’ resurrection - with him and through him - by rising from the places of darkness and death within ourselves and by choosing to live with him.  Each time we show our love for others, we share in the Resurrection. Each time we experience a betrayal of trust and, with God’s grace, forgive the betrayer, we share in the Resurrection of Jesus.  Each time we let go of a hurt and trust ourselves to heal, we share in the Resurrection.  Each time we continue to hope - even when our hope seems futile - we share in the power of Jesus’ Resurrection.  
 
The message of Easter is that nothing can destroy us - not pain, sin, rejection, betrayal or death, because Christ has conquered all these. With Christ, we will find our way to new life, as we put our faith and trust in Him. May this Easter help us to encounter once again the risen Lord in our lives and be assured of his abiding presence as we place our faith and hope in his saving love.
 
May the healing, life giving love of God be with you and your family this easter, and in the year ahead. Christ is Risen, he is risen indeed. Alleluia!

2021/04/11, 12:02 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Second Sunday of Easter – Fr Jerry Browne

The pyramids in Egypt are probably one of the famous structures in the world. They had great social meaning when they were built. Much more than just royal tombs, they represented the dignity and power of kings. So building a pyramid was a national project involving the entire country. Every household in Egypt sent workers, grain, and food to contribute to this project, which enabled the king to become a god in the afterlife. 

The final step in the building program was to place a capstone encased in gold on top of the pyramid. The capstone signified that the monumental project was finally finished, and it was a time for dancing and singing as the entire nation celebrated completion of the national project. In a sense, it was the pyramids that built Egypt rather than the other way around. The pyramids unified the nation in the service of one great and monumental achievement.

In our scriptures today, on this Divine Mercy Sunday, we are reminded of the importance of Unity, of community and of standing together. In the Acts of the Apostles (4:32-35) we hear how the early church emerged from the traumatic events involving Jesus’ crucifixion and death as they became more and more convinced of his resurrection. They continued to gather together, to break bread together, to share their stories with one another, their grief, their disappointments, and there hopes.  It was in these gospel values of prayer, solidarity, mutual support, and their concern for the sick and the vulnerable members of their community, that they began to encounter the presence of the risen Christ among them and came to a deeper understanding of their mission to share what they had received with the world. 

In our gospel today (John 20: 19-31) we get more of a sense of the paint that the disciples felt in those early days. Following the dramatic events in Jerusalem, we hear how they are locked behind closed doors, in fear of the Jewish leaders. Imagine their grief, their fear and confusion concerning all that had just happened! Surely, they were feeling battered and bruised, guilty perhaps that they had not done more - but they stayed together - united somehow in their grief for their friend.   It is into that place of uncertainty that Jesus steps, not with words of rebuke, but with words of healing, peace, mercy and forgiveness.

As if to draw attention to the importance of community, the importance of being with others who share faith in Jesus, the evangelist draws our attention to Thomas. Thomas it is heartbroken. His dreams are shattered, and it seems to him, that with the death of his friend, all is lost. His response is to withdraw - to step away from the community - to go it alone. 

In his absence, the disciples, gathered together, have a profound experience of the risen Lord, an experience that releases them from their grief and their fear and fills them with the conviction that they must step out into the world, to continue the work that Jesus has begun. When they share this information with Thomas, he is not ready to hear what they are saying, his solitude and isolation has not helped him to find the peace that he sought. Instead, he angrily declares that he wants proof - he wants to see and touch the holes, before he can believe that new life is possible. 

As the story unfolds, we see that Thomas finally meets the risen Lord, interestingly, when he is in the room with the others, gathered as a community. Jesus doesn’t dismiss him, or write him off, or get angry with him, but rather comes to meet him where he is. 

In that place of doubt, he offers Thomas what Thomas needs and invites him to believe. To believe he has risen indeed, to believe in the possibility that life has overcomes death, to believe that even though life has changed, that Jesus is still present, and will continue to be part of his life. Thomas, somewhat overwhelmed, accepts the gift of faith. 

The gift that Jesus offered Thomas, he also offers us. He can slip through the locked doors of our hearts, to find us in our fears and uncertainties, grappling with our questions and our doubts, our misgivings, our hurts and frailties. He says to us, like he said to Thomas, “Give me your hand; put it into my side. Do not be unbelieving anymore but believe.” God meets us where we are right now - not where we think we should - but as we are right now.

So today, as we gather here, if you are struggling, now is the time to look around you, to see that you are not alone. The body of Christ has come to church today, and he is here among us. There are very few people here without some pain, some struggle, some worry, but we are here together, strengthened in our unity. Let us draw strength from each other, and the power of the Holy Spirit, gifted to each one of us, as we walk together on the path that we find ourselves on. 

Let us place our hand in the Lord’s, trusting that we are not alone, that the Lord has risen indeed.

There is a story told about Jimmy Carter is a former President of the United States. He was also a very committed Baptist. Every year Carter’s home church would have a week of mission in which members of the congregation would go out into the community inviting unchurched people to attend the church’s revival meetings. Once Carter was asked to speak at another church in Georgia on the topic of “Christian Witnessing”. In his preparation he decided he would share about his involvement in his home church’s mission week. He began to note down that in 14 years he had managed to visit over 140 homes in the local community. Carter felt quite proud of his achievement, until he compared his witness for Christ with his witness for political office. Carter realised that in his 1966 campaign for Governor of Georgia he had gone out and met at least 300,000 people in an attempt to convince them to vote for him. Later he remarked: “The comparison struck me - 300,000 visits for myself in three months, and 140 visits for God in fourteen years!” 

I wonder if we took time to reflect on our life and our living, on our witnessing, what the results would be? Do we take time to give witness to the love of God in our lives? Do we speak about the risen Lord, do we help others to know Christ? 

A key theme in our scriptures today has to do with giving witness, how, following an encounter with the risen Lord, the disciples were willing to share their experience with others. In the gospel (Luke 24:35-48) we hear how the two disciples who had recognized the risen Jesus in the Breaking of the Bread have returned to Jerusalem to share with the other disciples what had happened on the road to Emmaus. In first reading (Acts 3:13-15, 17-19) Peter addresses a crowd is gathered in the Temple area. They have just witnessed a miracle at Peter’s hands and have questions about where his powers come from. Peter is quick to point out that it is in the name of the Risen Jesus that this healing has happened. How often in our lives do we give credit to the Lord for our gifts, for the good that we do in the world? 

Witnessing to the risen Lord was not without its dangers. History records that all of the apostles, apart from John the Evangelist, died a violent death. John was exiled to the Isle of Patmos for refusing to renounce the Faith. All of them went to their graves declaring that Jesus of Nazareth healed the sick, that he raised people from the dead, that he was crucified and rose from the dead and ascended into Heaven, and that they were witnesses to these things. As a result of their experience of the risen Lord, all of them gave their lives rather than turn their back on Jesus. What a testimony to the truth of Jesus’ life, to their trust in his teaching and to their utter conviction that the life he promised was truly attainable. 

The extraordinary change in the behaviour of the apostles, causing them to leave their locked room to boldly proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ, gives testimony to the life transforming event that took place when Jesus appeared among them. Just as with the apostles, Jesus pours out his spirit upon us and invites us also to be his witnesses. 

It is the Holy Spirit that helps us to let go of our fear, and to let go of all the things that blind us to love, our prejudices, our hurts, our addictions, the mistakes of our past, the bad choices that we have made, to let go of all these things, so that we can truly grow into the people that God wants us to be.

So the question for us today is whether or not we are open to the gift that Jesus gives us? Are we ready to allow the resurrection to make a difference in our lives; to empower us; to encourage us; to Inspire us? 

The Spirit that Jesus gives us is a Spirit of power, the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead. With his power at work in our lives all things are possible.

So today as we gather here, let us pray for the grace to allow the Spirit of the risen Lord into our lives, so that we might courageously live as people of God and join with Jesus in creating a world free of oppression, so that all might live in love; that all might come to know the power of the risen Lord in their lives; that all might be empowered to live as free people, the people God created us to be.

2021/04/25, 13:17 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Fourth Sunday of Easter - Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told about Sir Michael Costa, a great orchestral Conductor of the 19th Century. It is said that one day he was conducting a rehearsal in which the orchestra was joined by a great choir. Midway through the session the piccolo player stopped playing. It seemed innocent enough – after all who would miss the tiny piccolo amidst the great mass of instruments blazing away? All of a sudden Sir Michael stopped the entire orchestra and choir. “Stop! Stop, he said, where’s the piccolo? What’s happened to the piccolo?” To the master’s ear, the presence of the tiny piccolo was missed.
In baptism we take our place in the great orchestra of life. As we do so, we make a commitment that we will hold nothing back, that we will open our minds and hearts to God’s purpose for our lives, using our gifts and talents, however humble they may seem, to give glory to God in this place and time.

Today we celebrate World Day of Prayer for Vocations to Priesthood and Religious Life, also known as Good Shepherd Sunday, because on this Sunday every year we hear Jesus describing himself as the good Shepherd. The good Shepherd is the one who goes the extra mile to protect his sheep. He acts, not out of duty, or because it is his job, but out of love for his sheep. In the same way that a mother or a father cares for their children, not because of duty, or obligation, but because they love their children, so it is with Jesus. He loves each one of us as we are, not because of what we do or say, or because of our status in society, but simply because we belong to him. In a very real way our vocation, the way we live, the way we strive to use our gifts and talents, is our response to that love.
In his book Becoming adults, Becoming Christian, James Fowler, writes that “Vocation is the response a person makes with his or her total self to the address of God and to the calling to partnership.” In other words, our vocation is our response to God’s call and is an acknowledgment of our awareness of God’s presence in our life and our willingness to be co-creators with God, to participate fully in God’s plan for the world. What an incredible privilege that is, to be able to share with God, to help God’s plan unfold in the world. And each one of us have been given some precious gift to share. Our vocation is to share it, our call is to share it, it is our response to God in love.

While we traditionally think of vocation as something to do with priests, sisters or brothers, the reality is that through our baptism all of us have a vocation. That vocation is the response we make with our total self to the address of God and the calling to partnership.

We see this kind of response in many different ways, such as husbands and wives who can’t do enough for each other to demonstrate their commitment to each other – in a way they lay down their lives for each other; parents who make countless sacrifices for the good of their children – again they lay down their lives for their children; teachers who spend untold hours instructing the weak students, do the same thing; doctors and nurses who work untiringly to show they care for their patients; employers who share profits with their workers; politicians who unselfishly promote the common good of their voters, and so many others who generously give of themselves in order to help another, all lay down their lives to ensure that the world is a better place, and all participate in God’s plan for the world, when they do so generously and in love.  

Today of course, we pray in a special way for young men and women who may be considering a vocation to the priesthood or religious life. The prospect of living such a life can seem daunting, but, in reality, if it is the life that you are called to live, it is the greatest life ever.  If we are doing what we are supposed to be doing with our life, it is no burden, it is a grace, it is a gift, it is our response to God in love.

There may be times when we feel small and insignificant, or think that we don’t have much to offer, or it may seem that our contribution is insignificant, and that it won’t make any difference if I don’t answer the call – but it makes all the difference, think of the piccolo, because God uses every gift, every talent in every single one of us, to make the world a better place.

There are times perhaps when we are afraid to be different, to step out from the crowd, and march to the beat of our own drum, and yet the thing that distinguished the early Christians is that they were different, that they listened to the voice of God deep within, and that they took a chance and stepped out in faith.
So today, I want to invite you to stand out from the crowd, don’t be afraid to be who you are called to be by God. Don’t be afraid to use your gifts and talents. God calls us to live our life to the fullest, to reach our potential as human beings, to recognise ourselves as being made in the image of God who created us and knows us and desires our participation in the life of God in the world. So, as we gather here, let us pray for the courage to open ourselves to the prompting of God, the courage to listen deeply to God’s call, and the courage to act and live from that place.

2021/05/02, 16:23 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Fifth Sunday of Easter - Fr Jerry Browne

Some years ago, the members of a large parish decided to undertake a religious census among some 2000 homes in the parish. When the results were in, the priest began working through the reports. He paid special attention to the visitors’ notes and especially any comments they might have made at the bottom of the page. One remark that occurred again and again was, “Used to be a Catholic, now belong nowhere.” Or, “The children go to catechism, but the parents aren’t interested.” And then his eyes fell on one unusual comment at the end of one of the reports that simply read “Catholic but disconnected.” 

That is something of a contradiction in terms – to be Catholic and be disconnected. And yet, how easy it is to lose our connection with the Church, and with Jesus, to drift away for one reason or another, yet God created us to be in communion with God and with one another. In today’s gospel (John 15:1-8) Jesus describes himself as the Vine and makes it clear that in order for our lives to have meaning as Christians we must stay connected to him. “I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing.” Jesus is reminding us that we need to be grafted onto to him, to embrace his ways, his respect and care for those he meets, his willingness to forgive, his compassion for those in need, his trust in the Father, so that through him we can grow strong and stable in our faith and bear those fruits in our daily living.

It is at our baptism that we become one with Christ. It is also at our baptism that we become part of Christ’s body, the church. As church, as people of God, we journey together and help each other to grow in our faith. Gathering together every week - something that was denied us during the painful Covid pandemic - listening to God’s word, praying together as a community, encouraging each other with a word of comfort and support, being nourished by the Eucharist, and just seeing the witness of our brothers and sisters as they take the time to come together, are all essential elements in our relationship with Christ. We gather not only to encourage each other, but to encounter the risen Lord who assures us that “where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.” (Matthew 18:20)

The story is told about a member of a certain church, who had stopped attending Mass. After a few weeks, the priest decided to visit the parishioner. It was a winter’s evening, and the priest found the man at home alone, sitting before a blazing fire.
Guessing the reason for the priest’s visit, the man welcomed him in and led him to a big chair near the fireplace. The two men sat chatting and making small talk, but carefully avoiding the issue of church attendance.  After some time, the priest took the tongs from the rack next to the fireplace, and pulled a single coal from the fire.  He placed the glowing ember on the hearth. The two men watched as the flame slowly diminish and turned an ashen gray, while the other coals in the fire continued to burn brightly. Nothing was said about church attendance until the priest was about to leave. As he reached the door, his host said “Thank you so much for your visit and especially for the fiery sermon. You will see me on Sunday!

At the very heart of our relationship with Christ is the understanding that through baptism we become one with him. In our baptism we become part of the body of Christ, the church. As such, Church can no longer be something that is outside of ourselves, something that we ‘go to’, or ‘belong to’, something that happens on Sunday when we gather for the liturgy, instead church is what we become, it is part of our identity, part of who we are. Once we have made that commitment it is not enough to simply admire Jesus’ words and teachings from a distance, but instead we need to allow his word to transform us, to change us, so that our lives reflect the one we have come to know and love. We need each other on that Journey to encourage us and strengthen us.

Our Gospel today reminds us of our total dependence on God for everything. In order to bear fruit, we must remain attached to the vine otherwise we die. "As a branch cannot bear fruit by itself, but must remain part of the vine, neither can you unless you remain in me."

Often, we do not like to admit our dependence, but the fact remains that we are constantly dependent on others for our daily existence. There is no such thing as a solitary Christian – just as we need other humans to grow in our humanity, “Umtu ngumtu ngabantu” “a person is a person because of other people”, so we need the church, the body of Christ, to help us grow in our relationship with Christ and with other Christians. If we belong to Jesus Christ, we automatically belong to anyone and everyone else who belongs to Jesus Christ.

As so, as we gather here this morning, let us take time to give thanks for the gift of our community, for the gift of being able to share in the Eucharist, for the gift of the body of Christ, for the gift of the encouragement of each other, and let us pray that we might continue to grow in our relationship with Christ, so that we can be Christ for others in the world.

2021/05/09, 16:18 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Sixth Sunday of Easter - Fr Jerry Browne

A catechist preparing adults for reception into the church once gave his students an assignment to go to someone that they loved before the following week’s session, to tell that person that they loved him or her. They would then give their report at the next class. It had to be someone to whom they had never said those words before, or at least not for a very long time.

At the next session, one man stood up and recounted his story to the class. He said to the catechist “I was quite angry with you last week when you gave us this assignment. I could not understand how you dared to tell us to do something so personal. But as I was driving home, my conscience started talking to me. It was telling me that I knew exactly whom I needed to say ‘I love you’ to.”
He went on to share how five years earlier he and his father had had a terrible argument which was never resolved. The father and son avoided seeing each other since then, unless it was absolutely necessary, and even then they hardly spoke to each other. On the way home from class the man had convinced himself that he needed to tell his father that he loved him. He goes on to say “It was strange, but just making the decision seemed to lift a heavy load off my chest. When I told my wife, she jumped out of bed, gave me a big hug and for the first time in our married life, she saw me cry.”

The next day the man was up bright and early and went to work as usual. At 9.00am, he called his father to tell him that he wanted to visit him after work and talk to him. The father reluctantly agreed. That evening, as soon as his father answered the door, the man didn’t waste any time. He took one step inside the door and blurted out ‘Dad, I just came over to tell you that I love you.’ The man recalled how the moment was transformative. He said, “Before my eyes, my dad’s face softened, his wrinkles seemed to disappear, and he too began to cry. He reached out and hugged me, saying ‘I love you too, son, but I’ve never been able to say it.‘ My mother walked by just then with tears of joy in her eyes. I didn’t stay long, but I hadn’t felt that great in a long time.” He then shared that “Two days after my visit, my dad, who had had heart problems but hadn’t told us, had an attack and ended up unconscious in the hospital. I still don’t know if he’ll make it. So my message to all of you in this class is: don’t wait to do the things you know need to be done. If I had waited, I might never have had another chance to do what I did.”

In our readings today, particularly the second reading (1 John 4:7-10) and the gospel (John 15: 9-17) we hear the word love, in some form, mentioned 18 times. Jesus reminds us that as he was loved so we are loved. In fact, his whole life and ministry is based on his experience of God’s love and is a constant reminder that we are loved in a similar way. It is hardly surprising that love is mentioned so often, because there is real power in love.
It’s only three words, “I Love You”, but often, it is so difficult to say those words out loud, or even at time, to hear someone say those words to us.  But when we do say them, or when we do truly hear them, their power is transformative. Think of how it has impacted on your life. Think of its power, its ability to bring about change, its willingness to protect, to shelter, to forgive, to influence the course of your life? Love gives wings to our dreams and encourages us to be all that we are meant to be. Of course, there are also times in life when love’s power is stymied because of a hurt or a betrayal. It is perhaps then, in those moments of loss, that we understand most acutely that we are indeed made for love and that without love we are a shadow of who we are meant to be.    

Regardless of how we experience love in our human relationships, Jesus assures us that God knows each of us personally and chooses to love us, in spite of our limitations. He loves the real me, not the ‘me’ that I present to the world – the ‘me’ that I think the world wants to see, or the ‘me’ that I hide for that matter, that I haven’t quite accepted in myself. Rather he loves the complete ‘me’, the man or woman that I am today. God’s love is not blinded by our past, by our imperfections, by our pain or our history. He sees us for who we really are and loves us into who we can be.
Imagine how our lives would change if we truly believed that, that we are loved and accepted for who we are. 

Today’s gospel reminds us that in spite of our limitations, that indeed we have been chosen and called. “You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit, fruit that will last. Each one of us has something beautiful to offer the world, but first we must accept it for ourselves; accept that God’s sees something special in each of us; that each of us is loved for who we are, and that that’s all that really matters.

So today, as we gather around the table of the Lord, the great sign of God’s love, where Jesus gave himself completely for our sake, let us open our minds and hearts to the gift of God’s love, allow that love to touch us, heal us transform us, so that we too can share that gift with others.

- Life is full of choices that have the power to enrich our lives or impoverish them.
- We can either allow light into our lives, or darkness.
- Be determined that you will only allow His light to flood your life.
- Invest all you have in achieving this goal, and may you be filled with light.

🙏🏾 Prayer: Lord, I pray that You will remove everything that brings darkness into my life and soul. May I be more determined than ever to know Your light, and Your life in my life and soul, In the Name of Jesus. Amen - www.AliveToGod.com

2021/05/16, 16:54 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Ascension B 2021 – Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told about the Italian composer Giacomo Puccini. Puccini wrote a number of famous operas such as La Boheme, Madama Butterfly and Tosca. It was during his battle with terminal cancer in 1922 that he began to write Turandot, which many now consider his best work.  He worked on the score day and night, despite his friends’ advice that he should rest and save his energy. When his sickness worsened, Puccini said to his students and disciples, “If I don’t finish Turandot, I want you to finish it.” He died in 1924, leaving the work unfinished. His disciples gathered all that Puccini had composed of Turandot, studied it in great detail, and then proceeded to write the remainder of the opera.

The world premier was performed in La Scala Opera House in Milan in 1926, and Arturo Toscanini, Puccini’s favourite student, conducted it. The opera went beautifully, until Toscanini came to the end of the part written by Puccini. He stopped the music, put down the baton, turned to the audience, and announced, “Thus far the master wrote, before he died.” There was a long pause; no one moved. Then Toscanini picked up the baton, turned to the audience and, with tears in his eyes, announced, “But his disciples finished his work.” The opera closed to thunderous applause and found a permanent place in the annals of great works.

Today we celebrate the feast of the ascension – Jesus’ return to the Father and the end of his earthly ministry. While his ascension marks the end of Jesus’ worldly mission, it also marks the moment when his disciples were commissioned to continue the work that Jesus had begun. Jesus’ life, death and resurrection changed the course of human history. It changed how we see ourselves, how we see each other and how we see God. In Jesus, humanity came to a fuller understanding of what it means to be human and what it means to share in the life of God. In him we recognise a nobler calling for our lives, a truth about who we are meant to be that helps us to see ourselves and the world differently.

In our readings today, in both the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 1:1-11) and the Gospel of Mark (Mark 16:15-20) we hear Jesus share his mission with us. He commands the disciples, and us, to “Go into the whole world and proclaim the gospel to every creature.”  In other words, Jesus invites us to live as he has lived, to see in every man and every woman the image of God. The great commission is about being witnesses to Jesus’ life and mission, to his ministry of healing, his outreach of compassion, his courage in standing with the marginalised and outcast, his confidence in overcoming entrenched attitudes of exclusion and his work for justice.

In other words, we are commissioned to build each other up, rather than break each other down, to help each other reach our potential, rather than be threatened by our differences, to find ways to share God’s love and mercy and compassion, rather than looking for ways to undermine each other.

The great commission is outward looking, and calls us to reach beyond ourselves, to recognise that we only truly reach our full potential individually, when we create an environment where we all grow together, where we are all respected, and where each one of us is recognised as a child of God.

Of course, just because it is outward looking, doesn’t meant that we have to go to the ends of the earth to fulfil the mission of Christ. There is a story told about a woman, who after attending a convention led by the famous televangelist Billy Graham, wrote to him to with a dilemma. She wrote,  “Dear Sir, I feel that God is calling me to preach the Gospel. But the trouble is that I have twelve children. What shall I do?” Billy Graham replied: “Dear Madam, I am delighted to hear that God has called you to preach the Gospel. I am even more delighted to hear that He has already provided you with a congregation in your own home!”

In our baptism, all of us have been commissioned as Missionary Disciples, to be practitioners of our faith, wherever we find ourselves, in our home, in our work, in our schools, in our social life. We are not asked to do this on our own but have been empowered by the Holy Spirit whom we can turn to in every moment of every day.

Let this feast day serve to remind us of our baptismal commitment, to our ‘yes’ to share in Jesus’ vision to build God’s Kingdom on right relationships, peace, justice and love. Let us go forward in our mission to make a difference in the world, confident of the victory of Christ and his promise to be with us till the end of time.

2021/05/23, 13:30 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Pentecost B 2021 – Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told about a young woman who took her five-year-old son to a concert by great Polish pianist, Ignace Paderewski (say _Pade-rue-ski_). As the mother and son took their seats close to the stage, the mother met an old friend and got involved talking with her. In the meantime, she failed to notice that her son had slipped away to do some exploring. As the lights dimmed and the spotlight came on, the mother was horrified to see her little boy on the stage, sitting at the piano, innocently picking out "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little star."

Before she could retrieve her son, Paderewski walked on to the stage – walked over to the piano and whispered to the little boy, "Don't stop, keep playing." Then, leaning over the boy, Paderewski reached out his left hand and began to fill in the bass. Later, he reached around the other side of the boy and added a running obbligato, a musical line that must be included when the piece is properly played. Together, Paderewski and the tiny five-year-old mesmerized the audience with their playing.

In some way the image of the great pianist transforming the halting attempts of the tiny five-year-old at the piano is a useful illustration for what happened at Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came upon the disciples and transformed their feeble efforts into something powerful.

Imagine, the father caring for his children, supplying what is missing, guiding where guidance is necessary and enhancing our lives in immeasurable ways. 

Pentecost is a moment of empowerment, it is a transformative moment when the disciples of Christ recognise that they don’t have to ‘go it alone’ but rather, that in everything they do, the Holy Spirit will be there to ensure that God’s will and purpose is achieved.

In our first reading from the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 2:1-11) we read that moments after the descent of the Holy Spirit that the disciples were given a voice - a voice that could not be contained in that upper room.  A voice that needed to be spread to the wider world. A voice that proclaimed the mighty works of God. A voice that calls for transformation in the world.

We see this message reinforced in the gospel (John 20:19-23) when Jesus stands among the disciples, and after breathing on them sends them out with the same mission that he himself had received from the Father. In “breathing” the Holy Spirit upon them Jesus imitates God's act of creation in Genesis. Just as Adam’s life came from God, so the disciples’ new life in the Spirit comes from Jesus. And just as Jesus was sent by the Father, so the disciples, and us, are sent by Jesus to continue his mission. And what is the Mission? His mission was to heal a fractured world, to restore humanity’s relationship with God and one another. In offering the gifts of reconciliation and healing, Jesus helped us to understand our noble calling as sons and daughters of God and to value the dignity all people, seeing ourselves made in God’s image.

The mission of Jesus continues in the church today. Pope Francis reminds us of this when he writes “One of the great challenges facing the Church in this generation is to foster in the faithful a sense of personal responsibility for the Church’s mission, and to enable them to fulfil that responsibility as missionary disciples, as a leaven of the Gospel in our world. IN other words, reminding us that we too are ‘missioned’, we too are sent!

As Christians we have received the same Holy Spirit that fell on the apostles at Pentecost. Jesus comes and stands in our midst and sends us forth. “As the father sent me, so I send you.” He sends us into the world armed with the knowledge and assurance of His Love, empowered with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and asks us to make a difference.

Pentecost is about empowerment and about new possibility. It is the undeniable certainty that the world can be a better place. It is the assurance that out of death comes new life. It is a reminder that nothing is impossible to God. It is the realisation that God isn’t finished with this world yet – and more importantly that we have a part to play in bringing God’s plan to fruition. Our tradition tells us that Pentecost began 50 days after Easter. But nowhere in scripture does it say it ever ended. It goes on.  The Spirit is among us, guiding us all the time.

Pentecost sends us to change the world. As people of God, we know the way. We know the life that we are called to live.
Let us pray for a Spirit of hope and courage that we may never falter in our mission.  

Come Holy Spirit, enkindle in us the fire of your love. Send forth your spirit and we shall be created, and you shall renew the face of the earth.

There is story told about an old woman by the name of Mamie who made frequent trips to the post office. One day when Mamie got there, she found a  long line of people waiting to be served. Mamie only needed stamps, so a helpful person who was next to her in the queue asked why she didn’t just use the stamp machine as she could get all the stamps that she needed there, and that she wouldn’t have to wait in line. Mamie thanked her and replied, “I know, but the machine can’t ask me about my arthritis.”

Relationships are an integral part of our life. In fact, our very existence is defined by relationships with others. In the  isiXhosa language there is an idiom Umntu ngumntu ngabantu – a person is a person because of others people. We need each other to reach our potential. We need each other to be truly human.
Just think about some of the best experiences in your life. I have no doubt that you will find that they involves another person, someone that had a special place in your life; a friend, a parent a sibling or a lover; someone that you could open up to and be completely yourself; someone that appreciates you for who you are and allows you to be who you are meant to be.

On the other hand, some of the worst times in our lives have probably been when we felt abandoned, betrayed or cut off from someone who is important to us. The sense of rejection or isolation weighs heavily on us and can leave us feeling depressed and deeply unhappy – not ourselves.  

Our need for relationship goes to the core of our existence and perhaps makes sense when we contemplate the relational nature of God in whose image we are made. At the heart of God we find a community of love, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Our desire for companionship, our need to get a hug or an embrace from time to time, our craving for love and the deep longing of our soul for communion, is a constant reminder of our origins, and a deep affirmation that we are made in the image and likeness of God.

Just as the community of God knows and loves one another, so we are called to be people of love who treat each other with dignity and respect. In the Trinity there is no seeking of power where one dominates another, but rather a community of equals sharing in a creative power that is based on mutuality and trust that brings forth life.

God is ONE, we as humanity are ONE people. As such we need to recognise the dignity, the value, the worth, the equality of each other as we strives to live in communion with one another. Jesus’ life and ministry reflects this respect for the other and is evident in the way that he welcomes the stranger, forgives the sinner and heals the broken.

In today’s gospel, Jesus invites us to continue his ministry, when he sends the disciples to baptise ALL nations, ALL Peoples, and to teach what he has commanded. (Matthew 28:16-20).  Jesus’ great commission goes beyond imparting a set of doctrines but involves embracing a way of life that reflects the inner life of God; a way of life that is based on our communal nature, a way of life that invites us to put love at the centre of all our relationships, whether momentary relationships, like when I meet the beggar at the door, or long term when where I choose to share my life’s journey with another.

We are not alone in this great quest, because Jesus has given us the gift of the Holy Spirit, the one who is our strength. It is the spirit that guides us and gives us the  courage and wisdom to see each other for who we truly are, brothers and sisters equal in the eyes of God. It is the Spirit that gives us the courage and wisdom the we need to strive to transform the world into the image of God, and so make the world a better place.

So today, as we celebrate this great feast, let us allow ourselves to be held and experience once again the healing love of God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

2021/06/13, 14:35 - +27 82 851 5315: 11th Sunday - Cycle B, 2020 - Fr Jerry Browne

I recently heard a story about how easy it is for us to confuse our timing with God’s timing! 

A country newspaper had been running a series of articles on the value of church attendance. One day, a letter to the editor was received in the newspaper office. It read, "Print this if you dare. I have been trying an experiment. I have a field of corn which I ploughed on Sunday. I planted it on Sunday. I did all the cultivating on Sunday. I gathered the harvest on Sunday and hauled it to my barn on Sunday. I find that my harvest this October is just as great as any of my neighbours’ who went to church on Sunday. So where was God all this time?" The editor printed the letter, but added his reply at the bottom. 

Dear Sir, "Your mistake was in thinking that God always settles his accounts in October."

That's often our mistake too, isn't it - thinking that God should act when and how we expect God to act, according to our timetable rather than God’s. The fact that we don’t see the full story, only the little bit of it that we are in right now, often escapes us, and leaves us questioning God’s wisdom and even God’s presence.

In our gospel today (Mark 4:26-34), we hear two parables, parables that remind us that there is a timing in life that we don’t always understand. Mark is writing for an persecuted church. He just witnessed the execution and death of Peter in Rome, and sees the persecution and mistreatment of many of the followers of Christ on a regular basis. Many were questioning their faith and wondering where God was in all of this, had God abandoned them? Why doesn’t God Intervene?
Mark wanted to reassure the Christian community that despite appearances, that God is present and that God’s Kingdom, God’s desire, God’s plan for the world is unfolding, so he recalls the parables that we just heard today, where Jesus assure his listeners that they are not alone, that God’s kingdom is unfolding all the time.

In the first parable, Jesus compares the coming of the kingdom to what happens when a farmers sows seed in the ground. Once it is sown, the farmer waits for harvest time. Even though nothing seems to be happening, the miracle of growth is at work. Something is going on beneath the surface. The farmer can’t get a better crop by lying awake at night and worrying about what is happening – he simply has to trust that the seed grows of its own accord and cannot be rushed. In a similar way, there is a timing to the growth of God’s Kingdom that unfolds in a way that only God knows and that we sometimes find difficult to understand.

In the second parable, Jesus compares the Kingdom of God to a tiny mustard seed that eventually grows into a large shrub, big enough for the birds of the air to shelter in its shade. This parable adds an element of hope and surprise to our reflection on the Kingdom. We are so conditioned to expect that it is only the big and the strong that achieve great things, that we sometimes fail to see the potential in the little that we ourselves have to offer.
The parable reminds us that God is at work in every situation that we find ourselves in, no matter how tiny our faith, how unpromising our situation might be, God takes the little we have and brings forth the most amazing results.

Both parables are stories about seeds! Seeds that lay beneath the surface, where we can’t see or can’t fully know what is happening – we simply have to trust that something new is coming. The parables are a reminder to the early Christian community, and to us, that change is often slow and at times imperceptible, but it is sure.  God’s will, God’s plan, God’s kingdom will come to be. As Christians we need to trust that God is at work, that there is something going on beneath the surface.  

For our part we continue to water the seed and cultivate the ground. In other words we continue to pray and put our trust in God - and wait for the fruits to come.

I want to finish with a story about how a third-grader student surprised his teacher with an important truth: The teacher asked, "How many great people were born in our city?" The student answered "None!" "There were no great people born. They were born babies and then became great people."

Think about it, so often our expectations are for results now, but in reality life has to unfold. Let us pray for the grace today to live by God’s timing and not our impatient expectations.

In1989 there was an earthquake in Armenia that lasted only four minutes, but ended up killing thirty thousand people. As soon as the earthquake ended a father raced to the nearby junior school to find his son. When he arrived, he saw the building had been levelled. Looking at that mass of stones and rubble, his heart sank as he remembered a promise he had made to his son, “No matter what happens, I’ll always be there for you.” Driven by that promise he found the area closest to his son’s classroom and began to pull back the rocks and dig out the rubble. Other parents arrived and began sobbing for their children. Some were saying things like, “It’s too late - they can’t have survived - the children are dead. Even a police officer encouraged the man to give up. But that dad refused. For eight hours, then sixteen, then thirty-two, and then thirty-six hours he dug. His hands were raw, his energy was gone, but he refused to quit. Finally, after thirty-eight gut-wrenching hours, he pulled back a boulder and heard his son’s voice. He called out his boy’s name, “Arman! Arman!” A voice answered him saying, “Dad, it’s me!” Then that little boy said “Dad, I knew you would come, I told the other kids not to worry. I told them if you were alive you would save me, and that when you saved me they would be saved too. Because you promised Dad, ‘No matter what, son, I’ll always be there for you.’”  
 
There are moments in all of our lives when the unimaginable happens, when our world falls apart, and the situation we find ourselves in seems hopeless. Maybe our family is in trouble, our children are sick or a loved one dies, or our financial situation changes and we feel lost and alone, abandoned and afraid. It is at times like that that we need to cling on to our faith, to trust that, somehow, we will weather this storm too.
 
The story we heard in today’s gospel today (Mark 4:35-41) grapples with the question of faith in the midst of a crisis. It is a metaphor for the life of the early church and for our lives too.

Mark was writing for a church that was being persecuted, a church where people were being victimised, intimidated and mistreated for being followers of Christ. In the midst of these persecutions, the followers of Christ were wondering if Jesus had abandoned them, if they had been left to face the storm on their own.
 
Mark wants his listeners, and us, to understand two things. First of all, he reminds us that Christ is in the boat with us, in other words that he is aware of the storm or the turmoil that is going on in our life, and he is there with us in the midst of it. The second is that we cannot overcome the storms alone, no matter how experienced we think we are at navigating the troubled waters that we find ourselves in. In John’s gospel Jesus tells us: “Apart from me, you can do nothing.” (John 15:5). There is no doubt that Jesus’ disciples would have made every effort to control their boat before they called Jesus. When they failed, however, they cried out: “Lord, do you not care if we perish?” When they call on Jesus, Jesus doesn’t reprimand them for waking him, rather he questions their lack of faith, that they would have thought that he didn’t care about their wellbeing. Mark wants us to know that we are never alone and that if it feels like the Lord has abandoned us, that is fine to call out to him in our need.  
 
There is a story told about some people who were huddled together in a Church building seeking protection during a violent storm. A preacher was praying with great power in his voice in the midst of this storm, crying out, “Send us the Spirit of the children of Israel, the children of Moses, the children of the Promised land.” At this, an old man with less power but more directness prayed, “Lord, don’t send nobody. Come Yourself. This ain’t no time for children.”

Maybe that need to be our ptrayer too. Our responsorial psalm today (107:28-29) echoes this sentiment when it says “So they cried to the Lord in their need and he rescued them in all their distress. He stilled the storm to a whisper and all the waves of the sea were hushed” Just like the disciples in the boat, let us call out to the Lord in our need, trusting that no situation is beyond God’s power.

And so as we gather here today, we pray for that grace to put our faith and trust in the Lord, especially when times are difficult and find ourselves in the midst of the storms of life, trusting that we are not alone, but that God is with us, as he promised he would be. Uh

Fr John Powell was a well-known author and has published a number of books. One of his books is entitled, Through the Eyes of Faith. In it he shares a story about an experience he had when he was visiting someone in prison. During the visit he met an elderly woman who was also visiting the prison. Together, they went through numerous security checkpoints; they had to produce identification; pass through metal detectors; and were led by armed guards through countless doors made of strong steel bars. Through it all Powell recalls how he could not help but notice how this sweet, old woman smiled warmly at everyone, waved gently to the guards and called many of them by name and greeted everyone in a kind and loving way.

Impressed with her positive outlook Powell said to her, “I’ll bet you bring a lot of love into this world with your smiling face and words.” The woman replied “Father, I decided long ago that there are no strangers in my world, only brothers and sisters, some of whom I haven’t met yet.”

Reflecting on that experience, Powell later wrote “That lady drew out of me a deep and warm reaction of love. And gradually I came to realize that people are not one thing, good or bad, but many things. In every human being there is warmth, love, affection, but there is also hurt, anger, weakness. We stimulate or draw out of them one or the other.

It all depends upon our approach, and our approach depends upon our attitude.” Father Powell concludes “This was the genius of Jesus. He took people where they were and loved them into life. This is precisely what Jesus did for … those whose lives He touched. He was a living portrait of love in action. And the caption under the portrait reads: Please love one another as I have loved you. Yes… this was the genius of Jesus. He took people where they were and loved them into life.”

This is precisely what we see Jesus doing in today’s gospel (Mark 5: 21-43) when we read about the woman with a haemorrhage and the daughter of Jairus. For Mark, the woman symbolises all who are cast out and despised by society. She is considered ritually unclean because of a flow of blood, and because she is considered unclean, she is cast out by the community. Under the law, she is not permitted to share in the life of the community: she is denied entry to the temple; she cannot attend social events; and she is expected to exclude herself from the marketplace. Mark also makes the point that she had spent everything she had, so she is practically destitute - a ‘nobody’ in the eyes of the world. And yet, with all that she had against her, she had faith in Jesus to make her whole.

Jesus challenges society and convention by allowing himself to be touched. He is the ultimate symbol of religious authority and as such he is saying that this is how God’s representatives should give witness to God’s love. By reaching out to those in need, rather than creating barriers that exclude. He even draws attention to the fact that he has been touched by the woman, which is basically declaring himself on clean! We see Jesus repeat this when he touches the dead girl, another action that would make him ritually unclean. This doesn’t seem to matter to Jesus. Instead, he invites the woman to stand in the middle, he brings her from the outside to stand in the middle - he wants everyone to see. Jesus wants to show his followers, and us, that no one is beyond the love of God - that all are welcome in God’s kingdom. No one is excluded.
To the woman, a nobody in the culture of the day, Jesus says “My daughter, your faith has restored you to health; go in peace and be free of your complaint.” To Jairus, the young girl’s father, a synagogue official and the embodiment of the establishment, Jesus says “Do not be afraid; only have faith.” Bot spectrums of society are part of this story, the powerful and the weak. For both, the only condition for their healing is faith.

So, what might these stories be saying to us? First, they remind us of who we need to be as church, as Christ’s body. We are called to be welcoming, non-judgemental, caring and a healing presence in the world. Secondly, they ask us to have faith in Jesus. As he said to the synagogue official, “do not be afraid, only have faith”, so he says to us; “do not be afraid, only have faith.” That is not easy - especially when we find ourselves in a crisis, but that’s what Jesus asks of us. And finally, they remind us that God does not look at our status in society as the measure of who we are but looks rather at our willingness to put our faith and trust in him.

So today, as we gather here, what do these readings ask of us? Could it be that they are inviting us to a deeper faith, to trust that Jesus desires only what is best for our lives; or are they inviting us to be instruments of healing, in the way that we welcome others? Maybe, it’s to realise that life is tough enough for most people, and that a smile, a gesture of welcome or a kind word can make all the difference.

Let us pray for a deeper understanding of Jesus’ desire to bring an end to suffering, so that we too can easy the suffering of others and help make the world a better place.

2021/07/04, 12:31 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 14th Sunday - Cycle B, 2021 – Fr Jerry Browne 

There is a book entitled "Crossing Over" that tells the story of Ruth Garrett, an Amish woman who fell in love with a person outside the Amish Community, and who eventually ran away to marry him. Ruth had always been a little rebellious, but not even she could imagine the pain she was about to experience when she was shunned by her family and community. Rather than accepting someone who had a different upbringing to themselves, in their blindness, they chose to cast out their daughter rather the open their live to the man she had chosen to love, because he was an ‘outsider.’

Has there ever been a time in your life when you rejected someone just because you didn’t like the look of them, or they came from a different social upbringing, or a different race or culture? Have you ever found yourself jumping to conclusions, rushing to judgement, without knowing the whole story?

In our gospel today, we hear the story of how Jesus returns home, to the place where he grew up and worked. It seems that the people didn’t know what to make of him. On the one hand they were impressed by his wisdom and power. They had heard stories about the marvellous things he was doing around the sea of Galilee and in the neighbouring towns. They had heard stories of him healing people and of his preaching, and they marvelled at how he had become such a great man in the eyes of their neighbouring communities. 

On the other hand, they struggled with what they knew about him. He was local. They knew his family, where he grew up and worked. There seems to have been a suspicion that he might be illegitimate! They refer to him as Mary’s son, culturally one was usually referred to as the son of the father. Did they think he had risen above his station? That he was getting too big for his britches as they say, that he had no right to speak out like he did? And so, in spite of their favourable first impression, they let their prejudice, their blindness and their cultural bias influence their assessment of him, and they choose to reject him. Mark summarises their negative reaction in six words: “And they would not accept him”.

The little congregation gathered in the synagogue allowed the culture and social narrative that they had grown up in to become the measure of their own lives and the measure of everyone else they met. Their biased worldview blinded them to the possibilities before then, and they chose rather to reject Jesus than imagine that they might be wrong. 

We are all shaped by the cultural and social narrative that we grow up in! Like the folks in the gospel today we are all predisposed to making judgements about the people around us and the people who come into our lives – without having all the facts! We judge people because of their race, their culture, their nationality, their age, their education, their wealth, their position in society and a whole lot of other reasons. Every time we do that, we not only diminish the person before us, but we diminish ourselves as well. We prevent ourselves from growing, from discovering, from learning. Just like the people in Jesus’ hometown, who inadvertently rejected the Messiah because of their closed minds, what do we miss out on because of our prejudice, because of our closed minds?

Every day you and I face situations in which God is calling us to stop, to look and to listen, in order to take in some message for good, a message that from time to time, may be delivered to us by the most unlikely of people. Sometimes the message is challenging, because it asks us to look at life differently, because it may question some of our long-held beliefs, or it asks us to live with a new reality and be open to change the way live. 

Jesus came to open our minds and hearts to the fulness of life, to see the beauty in each other and to liberate us from our fears and prejudices. His mission is to heal what is broken and to reconcile what is divided so that our life and world can truly reflect the mind of God. 
So, what is the gospel asking of you today, and this week? Could it be that it is asking us to give someone a second chance? Maybe there is something that needs to change in the way that we treat the people you meet? Or maybe it is the invitation to discover the beauty of what our diverse society and country has to offer?  Let us pray for the grace to open our minds and hearts to God’s word, and the courage to let go of old ways, so that we can experience the fullness of life.

We are very sad to share this difficult news with you. 
We appreciate that so many of you have come to love our Centre and its mission because of Sister Ethel and her unwavering passion and dedication to improving lives.
 
After 50 years in South Africa, Sister Ethel is returning home to Ireland following her recent diagnosis of lung cancer.
 
Not one to ever draw attention to herself, she has opted to receive palliative care near her family and as such is quietly traveling to Dublin.
 
It is now up to us to continue her legacy and, being the visionary she is, she has prepared us well for it.  We will take our guidance from her values of gratitude, accountability, compassion and unconditional love.  It is her biggest concern that the care for those who are most vulnerable will continue and we are fully committed to ensuring that Sister Ethel's good work will continue to live on for many years to come.
 
As one of her last actions before leaving, Sister Ethel has written a letter to be shared with you today:
 
As I write this my life is ebbing away.
 
Thank you to the many, many strangers who have come to visit us since 1988 and who have become the friends, the building blocks of Missionvale Care Centre.  You are a family in my heart.
 
After 50 years in South Africa, I return to Ireland and I know you stand shoulder to shoulder with me.
 
I wish I could tell you how much I love you, how much I will miss you – the hugs, the tea, the stories told, and the unanswered questions!
 
Goodbye is only a word, as no cancer can take you from me, and together we will continue the work we begun!
 
I love you forever.
 
Ethel

2021/07/11, 13:21 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 15th Sunday - Cycle B – Fr Jerry Browne 

As I reflected on today’s readings (Amos 7:12-15 and Mark 6:7-13) I found myself pondering on the missionary nature of the church and whether or not we really take our baptismal commitment seriously! Pope Francis, in his 2019 message for World Mission Day, draws attention to this baptismal mandate when he writes “I am a mission, always; you are a mission, always; every baptized man and woman is a mission. People in love never stand still: they are drawn out of themselves; they are attracted and attract others in turn; they give themselves to others and build relationships that are life-giving. As far as God’s love is concerned, no one is useless or insignificant. Each of us is a mission to the world, for each of us is the fruit of God’s love.” 

As I reflected on that, I asked myself “Does my love for God really animate my life”? Does Yours? Does it flow out of us and make a difference in the way that we are with the people we meet? Does it cause others to want to know the God that we love? Do we get excited about your relationship with Christ? Do we want others to know the God that we love?

In both the first reading today and the gospel, we meet people who cannot ‘stand still’, who cannot help but call others to a new way of life, a way of life that they themselves have discovered through their relationship with God. In the reading from the book of Amos, we hear how Amos, a shepherd and a man who cared for sycamore trees, refuses to back down from Amaziah, a priest of Bethel, but boldly prophesies for the Lord. And in the gospel, we hear how Jesus sends out the apostles, two by two, fishermen and tax collectors, to preach a message of repentance, to call people back to God. 

There might be a lot of practical reasons for why Jesus sent them out in pairs. Perhaps there is safety in numbers, or maybe they offered encouragement to one another. But I think it goes beyond that. When Jesus commissions the disciples to travel together he is reminding us that Christianity is not a solitary endeavour, it is always about community. Remember Jesus’ words in Matthew’s Gospel “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.” (Matthew 18:20). 

Christianity calls us into community. It asks us to recognise that we share a mission that is most powerfully proclaimed when we live that mission ourselves. It is in the respectful ways that we welcome the stranger, or acknowledge the dignity of each other, or work together to overcome division, that we give witness to the one who sent us. It is a profound reminder that love does not exist in a vacuum but can only be found in respectful relationships.

As we often see in Mark’s Gospel there is a sense of urgency in this mission. Jesus tells the disciples to take nothing with them, but a walking stick and sandals on their feet. No food no knapsack, no money for their belts, not even a second tunic, the things that would normally be used for a trip. It seems that Mark wants us to make a connection between this mission that Jesus is sending his disciples on and the exodus event - when the people of Israel were released from their slavery in Egypt. Remember the instruction that the people received on how to eat the Passover? In Exodus 12:11 we read “and this is how you will eat; with a belt around your waist, sandals on your feet and a staff in your hand.“ 

The exodus event was about leaving a life of slavery, so that people could live in freedom as God’s people. It was about trusting in God and being prepared to embrace a new way of living. When Jesus sent the Twelve with their message of repentance, he was reminding the people how they had abandoned the covenant that they had made with God, a covenant based on a relationship of love, and how they had once again given their lives over to slavery of one kind or another. 

Maybe something like that happens to us too! We get caught up in the clutter of life, putting our trust in things and material goals. Slowly the love ebbs out of us, and we find ourselves enslaved to a job, or a status goal, or positions of power, even as we lose that which is most important, the heart of who we are in fact, our relationships of love that are the true meaning and purpose of our lives. We are made for love, not for things. 

So today as we gather here, what might these readings be asking of us? Do our lives reflect our love for God, and our desire to share that love?  Or have we lost our way? Do we need to turn back, to repent, to turn to the Lord again? Do we need to re-evaluate our lives and take time to become aware of the stumbling blocks that  hamper our relationships, our relationship with God and our relationship with the people around us? Is it time to start living differently? 

Today, let us pray for the grace to open our lives to God’s word, to the invitation of the Holy Spirit to put God first, so we might grow into the people that God want us to be. That’s our mission, the mission that we are invited to share with the world.

‘Commit your way to the LORD; Trust in Him also and He will do it.’

- There comes a time when we need to let go and let God take over.
- It is a time when we give and surrender ourselves completely to Him.
- When we reach this place of complete surrender then we can enjoy peace.
- As we release our ways into His hands, He can bring about His purposes.

2021/07/18, 11:57 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 16th Sunday - Cycle B – Fr Jerry Browne

One morning, a few years ago, the members of a Jewish community in Iowa, USA, arrived at their synagogue to find neo-Nazi graffiti covering the walls of their building. The entire city was outraged at this act of violence and disrespect. Two weeks later police arrested an 18-year-old man and his 17-year-old girlfriend. The community demanded that the two of them be prosecuted to the full extent of the Law. Before the case went to court, however, the rabbi from the synagogue asked to talk to the pair. The offenders were brought to the synagogue where they met with the rabbi, along with two Holocaust survivors, and three of the temple elders. 

Tears flowed as the rabbi and the members of the Jewish community told their stories of the horror of the Holocaust, of going into hiding and fleeing Nazi atrocities, of struggling to survive and make new lives far from their homelands, despite the scars and nightmares. The teens told their stories too. As a child, the boy had been abused physically and, as a result, had suffered a significant hearing loss and a speech defect. He ran away from home at the age of 15 and was taken in by members of a white supremacist group. Completely indoctrinated in bigotry and hate, he moved to Iowa to start his own neo-Nazi group. His only recruit was the young girl. The vandalizing of the synagogue was their attempt to call attention to their presence so that others might join their deranged cause

In their three-hour meeting, a dramatic change took place. The synagogue community came to see the two teens as lost, broken and frightened children, and the young offenders came to see the untruth of the propaganda they had been told about the Jewish people. The two teens asked for the temple’s forgiveness. 

In the Jewish tradition, forgiveness must be earned. So it was agreed that the two would perform 200 hours of service to the temple – 100 hours under the supervision of the temple custodian, and 100 hours studying Jewish history and the history of the Holocaust with the rabbi. It was agreed that they would review the progress of the young offenders in six months, and if the two had atoned for what they had done in the manner agreed upon, forgiveness would be given and the criminal charges would be dismissed. The teens exceeded all expectations. 

This story has a happy ending, because the powers that be were able to put aside their justifiable anger, and demands for justice, and discover the root cause of the  prejudice and disrespect that motivated the young offenders. The violent outburst and destruction of property was only a symptom of a deeper pain that had been left untreated for years. Instead of rushing to judgement, the rabbi and the other leaders took the time to hear the real story behind the behaviour of the youth, and that made all the difference. 

In some ways the story of the young offenders echoes the story of what happened in South Africa in this past week. On the surface there was violence, looting and destruction, but underneath there is  pain and suffering and a sense of having being betrayed by the leaders of our country. For too long, millions of people have been abandoned by our government, and by the rich and powerful corporations that enrich themselves while the poor get poorer. In a country where eighty percent of the population claim to be Christian, it is an abomination that the majority of our people should have to struggle daily to put food on the table, or should have to beg and borrow to send their children to school, or have to live in fear of being raped or mugged at any hour or minute of the day, while political leaders dine and party extravagantly, and drive cars worth more that the house that most people can afford to live in, if they are lucky enough to have a house. Self-interest and greed has been the downfall of our society. It is rare to see a leader who works for the common good and who manages to avoid getting caught up in the cycle of self-enrichment. And yet, that is the only way that we can turn our society around.

In our gospel today (Mark 6:30-34) we hear how, when Jesus saw the vast crowd, his heart was moved with pity for them, for they were like sheep without a shepherd. Having pity for the people is another way of saying that he had compassion for them, that their suffering touched his humanity. This openness of heart is the first step that allows a person to feel the plight of another and cause us to reach out to make a difference in their life. 

Like the Rabbi and the leaders of the synagogue, our country needs leaders whose hearts are open, people of compassion, people who allow their hearts to be touched by the pain of the people they serve, so that the needs of the poor and destitute can be put before self-interest. 

Let us pray that what happened during the week will be a moment of awakening for this country, for our leaders and citizens, to realise that we cannot continue to ignore the pain and suffering of so many who live in a sea of poverty, but that we, each and every one of us, must do more to build a society that is just and fair, where the dignity of all people is respected and not just the few.

Back in 2009, Cami Walker, at the age of thirty-five, published a book about her battle with multiple sclerosis, a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system resulting in impaired muscle movement, vision and fatigue. For Cami the impact of the disease was devastating. She spiralled into depression and in time became addicted to painkillers. One evening she called a friend for support. Instead of offering her pity the friend suggested that she needed to stop focussing on herself and rather do something for someone else, just one small thing, for someone else every day. 

The suggestion seemed strange to Cami, but she decided to give it a try. The results of her experiences are recounted in her book, _29 Gifts_. Each day she gave something away.  Many of the gifts were simple - a phone call, a bouquet of flowers to a stranger on the street, spare change to someone in need, listening to a friend share a problem. Yet the acts were transformative. As the time proceeded her life began to change both psychologically and physically. By day fourteen she was able to walk rather easily, and by day twenty-nine she was able to go back to work, part time. She still had the symptoms of multiple sclerosis, but her new routine gave her the ability to cope with them. She later reflected _“No matter how many material things we have we are still tempted to see ourselves in a place of scarcity. We are afraid we do not have enough or that we are not good enough. Giving moves us out of our story and connects us with someone else. Giving takes us out of a place of scarcity and introduces us to something much bigger. This experience not only enriches us, it heals us.”_

What a wonderful realisation! How often it is that our pain or distress comes from a place of scarcity, a place where we worry about what we don’t have, or what we have lost, or what might affect us in the future. Our place of scarcity causes us to focus in on ourselves only, and robs us of the gift that comes when we are able to share our lives with others. 

Both the first reading (2Kings 4:42-44) and the Gospel (John 6:1-15) today draw attention to the importance of sharing and letting go. In the first reading, we hear the story of how Elisha was given twenty barley loaves by an unknown farmer. The prophet in turn decided to share what he had received with others. He instructs his servant to give the barley loves to the men, but the servant worrying that there might not be enough to go around, asked how he could serve so many with so little food. His response, perhaps like ours at times, is measured. Maybe he is worried that there will be a riot, or that he will run short, or that there won’t be enough for himself. Elisha on the other hand, showed the alternative pathway which was based on trust in God’s abundance. 

In the gospel there is a similar scene, where Jesus looks to feed 5000 people with even less food than the prophet Elisha. He only has five loves and two fish, food that belongs to a young boy in the crowd. What would have happened if that boy had been unwilling to give his food to Jesus? I’m sure that Jesus would have found another way to perform the miracle. But in the story, Jesus’ ability to feed the crowd depends on the willingness of the boy to share what he has. We know that it turned out to be a good deal for the boy, because by  the end of the gospel there are twelve baskets of fragments left over, more than he would have had if he had kept the food for himself. So it is with us. 

The point of the story is not about the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves, but about the abundance that flows from our willingness to let go of whatever it is that keeps us captive, that robs us of our freedom – maybe it is our fear, our grief, our insecurities, our worries about what might be … it is about letting those things go and our willingness to trust in God. 

It is no accident that this miracle of the loaves and fishes took place shortly before the Jewish Feast of Passover. As such, it prefigures the ultimate act of Jesus’ self-giving on the cross. From that act of total surrender comes the infinite gift of eternal life, the ultimate covenant – promise - of God’s immeasurable love for us. And of course linked to the Passover is the Eucharist, where Jesus gives himself to us as a daily reminder of how we are meant to live – giving of ourselves, also. 

As we receive the body and blood of Christ, or join in spiritual communion during this time of lockdown, let us pray for the grace to model our lives on the self-giving love of Christ and to trust that as we let go of our insecurities, that our trust will indeed be rewarded. 

And so, as we listen to this word today, what might the Holy Spirit be asking of us? To give to the Lord from the little that I have, my trust, my fear, my grief, whatever it might be that I need to let go of – and then to strive to reach out to others in their need?

2021/08/01, 11:54 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily- 18th Sunday - Cycle B - Fr Jerry Browne

A few years ago, I read about a survey that was taken to determine the effects of religious observance on people’s lives. Two groups of people were chosen - people who go to church regularly and people who don’t go to church at all. The survey asked questions on issues ranging from belief in the divinity of Jesus to whether you would cheat on your taxes. There were questions about fidelity in marriage, about relationships about abortion and many other issues. The findings were somewhat surprising. The vast majority of church goers gave exactly the same answers as the people who never went to church! Only a very small percentage of the people who went to church on a regular basis had opinions, and a lived lifestyle, that were recognisably Christian. If you were to take part in a survey like that, how do you think that you would fare? How does your life differ from people who do not know Christ?

In our second reading today, (Eph 4:17, 20-24) Paul in his letter to the Ephesians reminds us that to be a Christian means to live a radically different life from the society around us. Being a Christian means living our life in a new way; it means more than simply being a follower of Christ, being an observer from a distance, but rather it is about making a conscious choice to change the way we live because of our love for Christ and all that Christ offers us. It means choosing to allow Christ to shape our minds and hearts until, in time, our choices become part of who we are. Just like riding a bicycle, in the beginning it feels awkward, but in time it is an activity that we can do without thinking about what we are doing – it becomes part of us. 

So what is it that shapes your mind? What do you allow to influence your life - often maybe unconsciously? If you were to compare the percentage of time that you spend watching television, surfing the internet, reading your WhatsApp, Instagram and twitter messages compared to the time you spend with the word of God or in prayer, how do they measure up? We are living in a time when we allow others more access to our personal space than any time in history. Whatsapp messages arrive on our phone unsolicited, often passed along without being checked for accuracy. We are becoming a society of consumers who blindly accept whatever comes our way - without questioning whether it is good for us or not – or whether it is good for society or not – and often we just pass it along as if it is the truth!

Is it any surprise that the values of most Christians differ very little from the values of the world around us, rather than reflecting the values of Christ? In our frantic search for meaning, for belonging and acceptance, we let the noise and distractions of the world fill us up, without questioning the value of what we are consuming, so much so, that often our live are so full of empty promises that there is no room for God.

It seems that the crowds who came looking for Jesus in today’s gospel (Jn 6:24-35) were also searching for answers. Some it seems had missed the point of their previous encounters with Jesus, so that Jesus tells them that they had “their hearts set on passing things”. Addressing them, and us, he tells them to dig deeper. He invites us to see in him the assurance of the fullness of life when he announces, “I am the bread of life; whoever comes to me will never hunger, and whoever believes in me will never thirst.” In other words, Jesus is inviting us to take himself as the model of our lives, to take him as our life: to live with love and mercy and compassion as he does; to live in right relationship with the people around us, as he does; to join our lives to God in prayer, as he does; to put God at the centre of our lives and to see God’s presence in the lives of the people that we meet every day.

When we live our lives in right relationship with God and the people around us, there is an abundance for everyone. It is when we are consumed by our own ‘wants’ only, with the things of the world that promise fulfilment - power, luxury, material things, status, it is then that others go hungry.
Jesus offers us an alternative, an alternative that is not always easy to live, but when we do choose his way - when we allow our lives to be shaped by him, it is then that we truly reach our potential and help others to reach theirs too. No smart phone or gadgets or worldly construct can help us to do that. Jesus alone offers us the fullness of life. 
So how will we respond to this word of God? What might we do differently? Perhaps we can try fasting? The church has wisely asked people to fast from food for at least one hour before coming to church, so that we might hunger for the Eucharist. Could we also choose to fast from the various forms of media, WhatsApp’s, et cetera that consume our live just for an hour before church, or even while we are in church, so that our minds are not so cluttered as not to be able to retain God’s word! If we continue to fill our minds and our lives with the offerings of the world, how can we expect that there will be room for the food that gives life? And so today as we gather here we take a moment to consider what we consume; what shapes our life. And to ask ourselves if we need to change what that might be!

2021/08/08, 11:32 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily, 18th Sunday, Cycle B, Fr Jerry Browne

In 1927 the wife of a Scottish preacher by the name of Arthur Gossip died suddenly. When the preacher returned to the pulpit, he preached a sermon titled “When Life Tumbles In, What Then?” In that sermon the preacher compared life to watching a plane pass through the sky during wartime. There you are, lying on your back watching a plane fly gracefully across a brilliant sunlit blue sky when suddenly it is blown apart by gunfire and falls to earth a tumbling, tangled mess of metal. For the preached the painful image of the plane suddenly being blow out of the sky was his way of trying to explain to his congregation the devastation, pain and hurt that he experienced with his wife’s unexpected death. He went on to explain that he didn’t understand this life, but that what he did know was that during this darkest period of his life he needed his faith more than ever. “You people in the sunshine *may* believe the faith, he said, but we in the shadow *must* believe it. We have nothing else.” 

It all very well to have faith when things are going well – but often, in reality, it is only when our life falls apart that our faith is really tested. Time and again we see this in the scriptures when, even some of the great names, find themselves questioning their ability to keep going. For example, Peter and the 
other apostles, who after the death of Jesus, are distraught. They don’t know what to do – some of them just want to give up and go back to their old life. In the Old Testament, we hear some of the prophets, like Jeremiah, Isaiah and Amos, complain time and again that God is asking too much of them, that God is asking them to carry a burden that they cannot bear. In our first reading today (1 Kg’s 19:4-8) we meet the fierce prophet Elijah, who has drawn the fury of the notorious Queen Jezebel after he had the prophets of the pagan god, baal, slaughtered. Jezebel had promised to visit the same fate on him as soon as she got hold of him. Fearing for his life, Elijah flees south toward the Sinai desert. This is where our first reading picks up the story. Exhausted from the heat and thoroughly discouraged, Elijah lies down under the shade of a broom tree and cries out “This is enough, Lord! Take my life, for I am no better than my fathers.” As with so many other women and men in the scriptures, who find themselves in what looks like a hopeless situation, Elijah begins to despair. 

Have you ever had one of those moments in your life - when everything just seems to be going wrong? Have you ever felt like Elijah, spiritually drained, and you think to yourself “I just can’t do this anymore!” I think there are times when all of us find ourselves in situations like that – when it all just feels too much. Maybe your marriage is going through a rough patch – and you can’t see any light at the end of the tunnel and you feel like throwing in the towel; or maybe as parents your teenage children keep questioning your authority and you find yourself constantly on the defence and you feel tempted to give in – even when you know that doing so is not the right thing to do – but you are just tired of the constant struggle; or maybe as a youth or a teenager you feel pressured by your friends to go down the wrong road, but you don’t know how to say ‘no’ because you are afraid that your friends will think badly of you – and so you decide to ‘fit in’ rather than stand out – even when your moral values might be compromised. 

Like the preacher who lost his wife, it is at times like those that we must dig deep and trust that we are not alone – that in fact God is with us in our struggle and is ready to help us carry our burden. Just when Elijah was about to give up, we hear how the angel of the Lord offered him strength and nourishment in the form of bread and water. 

It is amazing how the simple things in life can be enough to give us the lift we need. It seems that Elijah needs a second word of encouragements, before he finally set out on the journey again, strengthened by the food he has received. Sometimes we do too, and maybe a third and a fourth!

What the Lord did for Elijah he does for us time and again. The angel of the Lord might come in the form of a word of encouragement from a friend or a neighbour; or a word of scriptures that speaks to our situation; or a phone call from a friend that helps us through a difficult moment.  Every Sunday we have the opportunity to gather around the table of the Lord, bringing with us the burdens of our life, with the assurance that in this place, we will be strengthened as we share in the bread of life. We don’t need to do it alone God is with us. There may be times when we are tempted to give up like Elijah. In those times let us remember to draw deeply from the promise of Christ. Christ is the one who has the power to nourish us, to sustain us, to strengthen us and to enliven us. With him as our companion all things are possible. Let us pray for the strength we need to continue our journey, confident that we do not journey alone. God is with us.

2021/08/15, 12:28 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Assumption of Mary into Heaven - Cycle B, 2021 

Today we celebrate Mary’s assumption into heaven at the end of her earthly life. She received this unique and special favour not only because she is the mother of Jesus, but because she lived her life in harmony with her son. Mary is honoured because she has followed the footsteps of her Son in giving her life in the service of others. Courageously she accepted the role of being the Mother of Jesus, a role that was filled with many uncertainties and required many sacrifices as she adapted to events that unfolded in her life -  the journey to Bethlehem, the flight into Egypt, the years of living in exile, the constant uprooting and replanting, the journey to Jerusalem, the agony at the foot of the cross... Mary knew the rough and tumble of motherhood and more besides – and in all of it she remained faithful. 

At the council of Ephesus, in the 5th Century, Mary was described as Theotokos, literally the God bearer.  In today’s gospel (Lk 1:39-56) we see the significance of that title  when Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth, while carrying Jesus in her womb – she is literally the God bearer. In a way her visit to her cousin is a simply gesture of one woman reaching out to another to offer support and encouragement in a time of need – but it is also a great example of the selfless nature of the Christian life. When Mary hears that Elizabeth is pregnant, she doesn’t focus on her own needs at that time – of the extraordinary things that are happening in her own life - but asks herself “What does my cousin need?” It is then that she decides to act. She undertakes the difficult journey and visits her cousin in the hill country. 

Thinking of what another needs is not easy, because it means we have to move beyond our own preoccupations and the stuff that we are busy with, in order to imagine what good action would be a blessing to someone else: For Example, what does my teenage child need from me? What would help my husband or wife right now? How can I make a difference in the life of someone who is in need? How could I make my mother’s life easier? How can I be present to a friend who is sick or who has lost a family member? Taking action is important – in fact it is an essential part of our Christian faith – it is what Jesus does – it is what Mary does, but helpful action will not happen unless we first take time to set aside our own self-focus and allow space for the other in our life. When we do so, we open ourselves up to the plan of God in our life and begin to share in the mission and ministry of Jesus. That is essentially what Mission is about – reaching beyond our selves and helping to create a better world modelled on Christ. Mary was a woman on a mission  - one who literally carried Christ to the world. 
In the beautiful interchange between Mary and Elizabeth in today’s gospel we hear Mary’s hope for the world and indeed her hope for the child she is carrying. She see the possibility of a world where mercy will abound; where the hungry will be fed; where the lowly will be lifted up; where those on the margins are brought to the centre. It is only when we look outward that we can dream such dreams! In the Magnificat, that beautiful hymn of hope that we hear Mary proclaim, we see the power of dreaming big. The dreams of Mary, a 14 year old girl, are fulfilled in a remarkable way. The child she brought into the world became for us the source of mercy, he is the one who feeds our hunger, lifts us up when we are weighed down, carries us when we need to be carried. He is the one that helps us to see the world with new eyes and opens our lives to all that is possible when we think of the needs of others as well as our own. 

Like Mary, all of us get opportunities to bring Christ to the world. There may be times when that mission is not easy, times when we may even find ourselves struggling to remain faithful to our purpose in life - that’s just how life is – full of struggles at times. It is then that we have to cling to our Faith as we continue to help those we meet along the way, being a source of mercy when someone is down; a source of healing when someone is broken; a source of nourishment when someone is hungry; a source of care when someone is in need. That’s not easy when we are dealing with our own struggles, our own challenges, but it in that moment of reaching beyond ourselves, that we find healing for ourselves too. 

Today’s celebration of the Assumption looks forward in hope to the final victory of God over evil, violence and death. In the power of the life, death and resurrection of Christ, we are assured of God’s love, which is stronger than death. As we gather to honour the Assumption of Mary today, we give thanks for her “yes’ to God and the witness of her faithfulness through all the changes and upheavals that were part of her life. Like Mary, may we remain steadfast in our witness as we share the love of Christ with those that we meet this week. 

When we follow the example of Mary, we not only share our lives with others, but we also bring Christ, who is within us, to the people we serve. Like Mary, when we come to the end of our earthly life,  may we be found worthy to come to that place in heaven which God has prepared for those who love him.

2021/08/22, 13:28 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 21st Sunday, Cycle B, Fr Jerry Browne

I am sure that many of you have heard of Anne Frank, the young Jewish girl who hid in an attic with her family and four others while trying to avoid arrest by the Nazi’s during the 2nd world war. Anne recorded her thoughts and reflections in a diary which she kept while in hiding for over two years, before she and her family were discovered and shipped off to a concentration camp, where she died in 1945.  In one reflection Anne wrote “We make our choices, then our choices make us.”  

Somehow, all of us are the culmination of the choices we have made throughout our lives. The fact that our childhood circumstances might be different from each other, or that some of us didn’t struggle as much as others, doesn’t change the fact they we made choices, one way or another, that have brought us to where we are today. We might argue that if circumstance were different, our life may have taken a different path, and that is true, but the reality is that ‘we are where we are now’ and the choices we have made along the way have gotten us here. Where our path will lead us tomorrow, will be determined by the choices we make today. 

In our first reading today (Jos 24:1-2, 15-17, 18) we hear how Joshua, the man who succeeded Moses and led the people of Israel out of the wilderness into the Promised Land, calls the people and the leaders of the 12 tribes to a meeting at Shechem.  Joshua knows that his life is coming to an end, and it seems that he is not confident that the people of Israel will continue to worship the Lord, who led them out of the land of Egypt. In fact, Joshua is afraid that they will begin to worship other gods, the gods of their ancestors, or the false gods of the land that they now inhabit. 

So Joshua calls the people together and asks them to decide which god they will serve. In inviting the people to make their own decision, Joshua realises that there is no point in forcing anyone to do something that they don’t want to do. So instead of demanding that they serve the Lord who brought them out of their slavery, he humbly invites them to make a choice, but then leads with the witness of his own life when he declared “As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.”

Maybe there is a lesson there for us when it comes to the people in our life that we worry about, because they no longer practice their faith. Perhaps we need to give them their freedom, and instead of forcing them or laying a guilt trip on them, we simply say “you must decide how you serve God in your life – but then like Joshua add, ‘As for me, I intend to continue to practice my Catholic faith.”

The choice that Joshua offered his people is echoed in today’s gospel (John 6:60-69) when Jesus offers his disciples the option to stay with him or to walk away.  On hearing Jesus’ teaching on the bread of life, many people are horrified! Some describe his teaching as intolerable and thought that he was blaspheming. Some just walk away. As the people leave, Jesus turns to his disciples and gives them the option to leave also. “Do you want to go away too,” he asks. Peter, on behalf of the group, announces that there is nowhere to go, that they recognise that Jesus has the message of eternal life. He is the one that gives life and they have made the choice to be faithful to him.

Acknowledging that Jesus is the son of God, that Jesus is the one who brings life, is not a once off declaration, but something that needs to be reaffirmed again and again in our lives. Decisions of faith, indeed most choices that we make in our life, whether in our marriages, our friendships, our political allegiance, or the moral decisions that we make, are never settled once and for all. We need to affirm them time and again. 

As we are faced with new options, as our life changes, as new opportunities arise, or when suffering visits – or prosperity for that matter – we will find that our faith is faced with new questions. It is in those moments that we have to decide if we are going to be faithful to the faith commitment that we have made. 
Every Sunday we gather here as a community of faith. We listen to the word of God; in our profession of faith, we say yes to living with God in our lives; we share in the bread of life and affirm our belief in Jesus as the one who gives us life. Then we leave here, we are missioned, sent out to be Christ in the world. What happens when we return to our homes, our schools, our places of work, our day-to-day lives? Do we choose to live and to serve the Lord? Or do we slip back into “our old way of life”.

In every situation that we find ourselves we have the freedom to choose, the freedom to believe that God is real and present. We can choose to remain open to that presence.  In every situation we have the freedom to live with love, with justice with integrity.  Although we cannot control what life will bring our way, we can choose how we will live life.  That decision is ours. So today, as we gather here, we are being invited to choose again – to affirm our ‘yes’ to live as God’s people, our ‘yes’ to living as people of love and mercy, as people of justice and integrity, as people who choose to put Christ at the centre of our lives. The rest of our life will be shaped by the choices we make today. As Anne Frank says, “We make our choices, then our choices make us.”

Last year a malignant growth was removed in Cuyler hospital. She was told that she was clear of cancer. A few days out of hospital she tested positive  with Covid-19 and then her husband too. 
In Dec her husband had officially retired mainly so that they could be free to look after grandchildren but also tour around the parts of SA, and especially nature reserves that they hadn't yet visited. By March they couldn't do any of this, except looking after their primary school grandchild as her mother works full time (social worker at UPH). She recovered a bit but quickly deteriorated again. For the last few weeks  she couldn't eat or drink as she was unable to swallow. She was in a coma for the last 48 hours. 

I can never be angry with God butbuts hard uo understand why some people go through so much and others die quickly. A former Deputy Principal of our school  passed away this week- 9 weeks ago she took ill and was diagnosed with cancer! How to you  cope with such problems?

2021/08/29, 12:45 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 22nd Sunday, Cycle B, Fr Jerry Browne 

Dr. Laura Schlessinger is a psychologist who draws attention to the culture of moral relativism that is very prevalent in society today. In her book, _How Could You Do That?_ Dr. Laura tells a story of a young woman who was living with her fiancé and who called her for advice. The young woman’s future mother-in-law wanted the couple to move closer to her home once they were married. The problem was, however, that the young woman claimed to be an Orthodox Jew, and she complained that if she moved closer to her future mother-in-law’s home, then she would be too far away from the synagogue. Instead of walking to Shabbat services, she would then have to drive, which would be breaking the Sabbath law. Dr. Laura couldn’t get the young woman to understand the inconsistency between observing one precept of her faith, honouring the Sabbath, but not caring if she violated another - the prohibition against living with her fiancé out of wedlock. 

Does Dr Laura’s experience with this woman sound familiar? Do you ever find yourself in a similar dilemma – where there is a disconnect between your religious convictions and the reality of your day to day living. And why might that be? Could it be that your religious observance has more to do with external practices than a way of life that has shaped your whole life?  

In the Gospel today (Mk 7:1-8, 14-15, 21-23) we hear how the pharisees and some scribes question Jesus as to why his disciples do not follow the tradition of the elders but instead eat their food with unclean hands. Jesus responds with a stinging criticism of his interrogators who have placed extraordinary emphasis on external rituals while neglecting what was far more important – an interior disposition that revealed their love of God and care for their fellow-human beings.  

When we read this gospel it is important to remember that Jesus is not criticising or rejecting the Jewish law, or even Jewish tradition for that matter. He himself was a Jew and was very vocal in his defence of the Law. In Matthew 5:17 we hear him declare “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfil them.” So when he responds to his questioners his point is not to criticize the law but to challenge people to go beyond the superficial keeping of a rule, to the deeper purpose of the law. The deeper purpose of course has to do with growing in holiness, a process of change, both in behaviour and attitude, that sees a person letting go of selfish, self-centred, ways and embracing a way of life that echoes the life of God – a life of integrity, love and compassion; a life that offers a helping hand to a brother or sister who may be struggling rather than taking pride in one’s own ‘good’ behaviour when compared to the frailties and failures of a neighbour. Holiness is a life long journey that comes with a conversion of heart that not only touches the depth of who we are, but also connects us with the humanity of one another. It is ‘inside’ work that eventually shapes our daily actions. It takes account of our own weaknesses and teaches us both humility and compassion. 

This is why Jesus places so much emphasis on what is happening in a person’s heart! Because if the heart has not discovered and experienced love - love that is capable of embracing one’s own failings - then we are limited to encountering one another at a head level, the seat of reason and judgment. Of course reason and judgement are important aspects of what it means to be human, but when left unchecked, without the balance that the heart’s gifts bring, reason and judgement can be cruel and unforgiving, limited as they are to human interpretation, logic and mathematical equations. Love on the other hand, brings something of the divine to a situation and helps us see one another as brothers and sisters who are meant to help each other grow as human beings, rather than focussing on difference, status and worthiness. 

So, as we gather here today, where do we find ourselves in this story? The famous danish philosopher, Søren Kierkegaard, used to say that “Reading the bible is like looking into a mirror.” In other words the scripture is meant to help us reflect on our own reality. It is very easy to look at the scribes and pharisees, and any of the other characters in the scriptures for that matter, and judge their behaviour, but that is to miss the point. At the end of the day we need to remind ourselves that “This passage has a message for me!” So, what is it in this story that unsettles you? What does it say to you about the connection between your profession of faith and your day to day living? Let us pray for the grace to recognize the areas of our life that still need work as we strive to grow in holiness with each passing day.

SEPTEMBER 5, 2021

Twenty-Third Sunday in Ordinary Time

Fulfillment

Here is your God, he comes with vindication; with divine recompense he comes to save you. Then will the eyes of the blind be opened, the ears of the deaf be cleared; then will the lame leap like a stag, then the tongue of the mute will sing.   Isaiah 35:4-6

As the prophet Isaiah offers a hymn celebrating the restoration of Jerusalem, we glimpse the magnificence of the power of God. For mighty miracles will accompany that blessed time: “he comes to save you.”

Today’s Gospel from Mark offers the blessed fulfillment of that prophetic hymn as Jesus, whose name means “God saves” or “savior,” heals the man who is both deaf and mute. The touch of Jesus opens the man’s ears and allows him to speak, perhaps even to sing!

We, too, are called to live this faith—acknowledging this fulfillment: Jesus comes to save us!

Lord, may my ears hear your Word and my lips voice my praise of you both in prayer and in my conversations with others.

2021/09/12, 17:41 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 24th Sunday, Cycle B, Fr Jerry Browne (National Director of the Pontifical Mission Societies)

Albert Schweitzer was probably one of the most famous missionaries of the last century. As a medical missionary he set up a medical clinic in French Equatorial Africa, now known as Gabon. When he was 85 years old he received a visit from Andrew Davison, a lecturer at a seminary in the United States. Davison tells how one morning, at around 11.00am, himself and Schweitzer and some others were walking up a hill. It was extremely hot. As they walked the 85 year old Schweitzer walked away from the group. He made his way toward a woman who was struggling up the hill carrying a large load of wood for her fire. Schweitzer took some of  the wood from the woman and helped carry it up the hill for her. When Schweitzer re-joined the group one of the members asked him why he did things like that. He, like others in the group, was concerned that a person of Schweitzer’s age would strain or hurt himself while trying to help someone else. Schweitzer pointed to the woman and said, “No one should ever have to carry a burden like that alone.”

For Schweitzer to be a follower of Christ means consciously making Christ’s life the model for our own lives. The Christian life is can be witnessed in the fruits of respect, care and practical acts of kindness that are inspired by our faith in Jesus. This sentiment is echoed by St James in today’s second reading (James 2:14-18) when he insists on the necessity of practical acts of kindness when he declares “What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and has no food for the day, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, keep warm, and eat well, ” but you do not give them the necessities of the body, what good is it?  So also faith of itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” In other words our faith must go beyond words and find its expression in service to others, especially the needy.

In a world that puts ‘self’ before all else, this message is truly counter cultural. It brings us back to the heart of the gospel where sacrifice and self-denial are seen as essential elements in the life of one who chooses to follow Christ. Jesus, in today’s gospel (Mark 8:27-35) makes it clear that all would-be disciples will need to let go of old ways, often at a cost to self, when he says “Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.” 

Christianity has grown and spread throughout the world because of people who took this invitation to heart, people who were willing to sacrifice something for God; people who at different times in history chose a martyr’s death rather than deny their faith in Christ; generations of Christians who clung to their faith even when confronted by the violence and hatred of this world; people who boldly professed and lived their faith while being scorned for their beliefs.

In our own time the challenge for us is to be willing to make the day-to-day sacrifices that are necessary in a world that may not violently oppose the Christian faith, but that has, when all things are considered, chosen a different path. It is about daring to do what Jesus did: being willing to speak when it is safer to stay silent; being willing to sacrifice some of our time in order to accompany the most vulnerable, to minister to people in need and to empower all people to live life more fully. It is about being willing to visit Jesus in a homeless shelter or soup kitchen; or risking our job security by refusing to “go along” with a policy that is unjust; or letting go of our need to be in control and following the promptings of Christ in our day to day lives!

And so, as we gather here today, let us pray that we respond to the person and message of Jesus, not by words, as James says in the second reading, but by attitudes and actions that reflect the radical vision of Christian life.

2021/09/19, 12:18 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 25th Sunday, Cycle B, Fr Jerry Browne 

A member of a monastic order once committed a fault. A council was called to determine the punishment, but when the monks assembled, it was noticed that Father Joseph was not among them. The superior sent someone to call him as everyone was waiting. So Father Joseph got up and went. He took a leaking jug, filled it with water, and carried it with him. When the others saw this they asked, “What is this, father?” The old man said to them, “My sins run out behind me, and I do not see them, and today I am coming to judge the error of another?”  

Fr Joseph was a wise man who had come to recognise and accept his own frailties and shortcomings. It is a journey of discovery that we all need to make. If we are honest with ourselves, somehow, our frailties will lead us to a place of humility – a deep understanding that we are no different from anyone else, and in fact that there are no perfect people in the world – only other imperfect people like ourselves trying to make the most of their lives. 


This is one of the great lessons of the gospel. Again and again we see Jesus reaching out to people whom many have dismissed, the sick, the weak, the poor, those caught in adultery. He chose fishermen and tax collectors as his apostles, rather than scribes and scholars, weak men who in time doubted him and even betrayed him. He welcomed those who were broken and needed healing, from the blind and the crippled to those who were possessed or spiritually lost. Time and again, we see Jesus looking beyond the external trappings of a person’s situation, focussing instead on the dignity of the person. 

So in today’s gospel (Mark 9:30-37), it should come as no surprise that Jesus takes the apostles to task when they begin debating among themselves as to who is the greatest. To settle the dispute, Jesus takes a child and declares “Anyone who welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me.” This was a graphic and powerful message about the kind of world that Jesus envisioned. Children were seen as having no value, the lowest members of society. In fact, the vulnerability of children was so pronounced that in times of famine, they waited until the adults were fed, before they got food. In dangerous situations, the elders were the first to be protected. 

By embracing the child, Jesus is not only making a counter cultural statement about the value and worth of every member of society, and insisting that there can be no distinctions among his followers, but he is also reminding the apostles and us, that like every child who has ever lived, regardless of race, culture, or background, that we are, ultimately, helpless and dependent. We might think that we are powerful, or that we have things under control, but anyone who has gotten sick or experienced a family bereavement, is painfully aware of how vulnerable we truly are. 

The realization that one is as helpless as a child naturally fosters humility, a necessary quality for true happiness. 

Humility is not about thinking less of oneself, or undermining our sense of value and self-worth, but rather is the ability to see ourselves as we truly are and not be overwhelmed by what we see. It is the wellspring from which freedom springs, as it liberates us from the need to pretend that we are perfect, or the best, or any other message that we keep telling ourselves regarding our self-importance or lack thereof.  Humility simply grounds us and helps us to keep life in perspective.  

We can easily forget that God Himself practiced the greatest form of humility when He took on our human form, and became one like us.  And He continues to show us boundless humility at every Mass, when He comes to us in the Eucharist: the creator of all offers Himself to us in something so small we can hold it in the palm of our hands. He loves us that much. 

As we receive Him again this day, let us remember that greatness is not about external power or wealth, but in our ability to love those we encounter in our daily lives, and to love ourselves for who we are. Because as Jesus told us, it is when we live from a place of love that we love him – and the One who sent Him.

2021/09/26, 11:46 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 26th Sunday, Cycle B, Fr Jerry Browne

Two shopkeepers were bitter rivals. Their shops were directly across the street from each other, and they would spend each day keeping track of each other's business. If one got a customer, he would smile in triumph at his rival. One night an angel appeared to one of the shopkeepers in a dream and said, "I will give you anything you ask, but whatever you receive, your competitor will receive twice as much. If you were to choose riches, you can be very rich, but he will be twice as wealthy. If you wish for a long and healthy life, your neighbour’s life will be longer and healthier. If you choose to have worldly fame, your competitor will be twice as famous. So what is it that you desire?” The man frowned and thought for a moment, before replying – I want you to strike me blind in One eye.”

Jealousy and envy can destroy our lives and lead us down a road that unleashes all kinds of negative behaviour. When envy controls our life we end up longing for what someone else has, be it a talent, a possession or a skill. When jealousy ensnares us, we live with the fear that something that we possess, a position at work, the limelight we enjoy or more commonly the affection of someone we love, will be taken by another who seems to be more attentive, attractive or capable than we are. Either way, if we are living with fear or longing, we are failing to appreciate and recognise the gifts we already have, all the while counting the blessings of someone else. 

These basic human frailties are the subject of both the first reading (Numbers 11:25-29) and the gospel (Mark (;38-43, 45, 47-48) this morning. In the first reading we hear how Joshua, Moses’ assistant from a young age, and his soon to be successor, wants to stop the activities of Eldad and Medad, because they hadn’t been in the Tent of Meeting when the Spirit came to rest upon the 70. In the gospel we hear a similar story when John wants to stop someone from doing the Lord’s work, because he wasn’t ‘one of us’. 

Both Moses and Jesus challenge the young men who come to them and invites them to see how, despite the fact that the people they tried to stop are not members of the group, that they are adding value to the lives of the people they helped. Moses asks "Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the people of the LORD were prophets! Would that the LORD might bestow his spirit on them all!" In other words, don’t try to limit the work of the Spirit to fit the smallness of your life. In a similar way, Jesus could see that even though the man that the disciples tried to stop was not his disciple, he was still doing God’s good work. Gently he reminds the disciples that ‘Anyone who is not against us is for us’, and even goes on to suggest that the smallest gesture of service will be rewarded – regardless of who does the serving when he declares “Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, amen, I say to you, will surely not lose his reward.” 

Both these gestures are worth remembering in our current times. There are a lot of people who don’t belong to the church in any explicit way and, yet, they are living lives that embody many of the values of the gospel message, very often working so that people may have a life more in keeping with their human dignity. 

Not only does Jesus encourage us to recognise the good in all people, regardless of whether they are disciples or not, but he goes on to caution us Christians to be extra careful when it comes to putting stumbling blocks in the way of another. Using graphic language that involves the cutting off of body parts that cause us to sin – like a hand or a foot or an eye, Jesus uses hyperbole – exaggerated speech – to encourage us to root out the things in our life that end up destroying us in the long run – things like jealousy, envy, lack of forgiveness, bitterness or anger. Clearly, Jesus does not expect us to take this text literally. Rather he is using vivid imagery to make his message more forceful. These characteristics not only hamper our own growth and well-being, but also act as stumbling blocks in the lives of the people we encounter daily. Jesus’ strong language reflects the reality that often, these emotional scars are deeply embedded and require more than willpower alone. God’s grace is necessary.  

So today, as we gather here, we are invited to take a moment again to pray for the grace to see ourselves as God sees us; to let go of the negativity that might be in our lives; to trust that we are blessed in abundance as we are, and to realise that there is no need to long for the gifts of another. Let us entre this week with a spirit of gratitude giving thanks for today’s blessings, and with a desire to help those we meet along the way.

The story is told that Alexander the Great, probably one of the greatest political rulers of all time, was returning home after conquering many kingdoms, when he fell ill and found himself close to death. With death staring him in his face, Alexander realized how his conquests, his great army, his sharp sword and all his wealth were of no consequence. He now longed to reach home to see his mother’s face and bid her his last farewell. But, he had to accept the fact that his sinking health  would not allow him to reach his distant homeland. So, as the mighty conqueror lay dying he called his generals and said, “I will depart from this world soon, I have three wishes, that I want you to carry out. The generals agreed to abide by their king’s last wishes. Alexander went on to say “My first wish is that my doctors alone must carry my coffin. My second is that when my coffin is being carried to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard be strewn with gold, silver and precious stones which I have collected in my treasury. And finally my last wish is that both my hands be kept dangling out of my coffin”.

The people who had gathered there wondered at the king’s strange wishes. Agreeing to his request one of Alexander’s favourite generals asked, O King, tell us why do you make such strange wishes?” At this Alexander took a deep breath and said: “I would like the world to know of the three lessons I have just learnt. I want my doctors to carry my coffin because people should realize that no doctor on this earth can really cure anybody. They are powerless and cannot save a person from the clutches of death. So let not people take life for granted. 

The second wish of strewing gold, silver and other riches on the path to the graveyard is to tell people that not even a fraction of gold will come with me. I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people realize that it is a sheer waste of time to chase wealth. 

And about my third wish of having my hands dangling out of the coffin, I wish people to know that I came empty handed into this world and empty handed I go out of this world”. 

Alexanders final wishes somehow represent lessons learnt too late – on his death bed. How easy it is to get distracted with power and wealth and the trappings of life and miss what is really important.  

In our Gospel today (Mark 17: 10-30) we see how the attraction of wealth and riches can prevent us from making choices that, ultimately, will lead us to a more fulfilling life. 

A rich man runs up to Jesus and asks what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus answers by giving him the response that any Rabbi would have given: you know the commandments; you must not kill; you must not commit adultery; you must not steal; you must not bear false witness (lie); you must not defraud; honour your father and your mother. The rich man is delighted because he has done all that – from his earliest days – and yet, even though he had kept all the commandments, there was something missing. We are told that Jesus looked steadily at him and loved him and then presented the ultimate challenge, to go and sell everything he owned and give it to the poor – and then to follow Jesus.  That was a real challenge – because for the Jews riches were a sign of God’s blessing  - poverty a sign of God’s disfavour. Jesus challenges that mind-set - a mind-set that still exist today in our lives if we are honest about it. In doing so he invited the young man, and us, to look honestly at who we are and asks us to see where we really place God in our lives. As Christians we all profess to want to be in right relationship with God - but on who’s terms? 

The rich man wanted to inherit eternal live but could not let go of the control that his riches afforded him. In a way the teaching of Jesus goes beyond wealth and riches, and challenges whatever it is in our life that limits our freedom and openness. How often do we pray “Help me Lord to live the life that you want me to live” - but secretly we think, but don’t ask me to forgive so and so; “Help me Lord to live the life that you want me to live” but don’t ask me to leave my comfort zone; “Help me Lord to live the life that you want me to live” but don’t ask me to let go of my jealousies; or my anger; or my racial bias; or my addictions; “Help me Lord to live the life that you want me to live” but don’t ask me to change. 

So, what this gospel really does is to ask us ”What is it that controls my life” What is it that keeps me bound to a certain way of living that limits my freedom? What is it that enslaves me? What do I find difficult to let go of? Somehow that is our real god – where we place our priority. It is not possible to follow Jesus, if we are not willing to let go of a way of living that goes against what Jesus teaches. 

In reality our time is limited, it might not seem so when we are younger, but as we get a little older, hopefully this becomes apparent and we realise that it is too short to be living a life that is not free. Let us pray for the grace that will free us to be the people God desires that we become, people who can listen to the spirit within us and not be overwhelmed by the opinions of others; people who have the courage to follow our heart and intuition – for somehow they already know the path to life. 

And so today, as we gather here we take a moment to reflect on our life and to ask ourselves, “what is it in my life that prevents me from being a follower of Christ? What is it that I need to let go of, so that I can truly inherit eternal life?”

2021/10/17, 17:24 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 29th Sunday, Cycle B – Fr Jerry Browne 

There is a story told about a boy who was always late getting home from school. There was no good reason for him being late, and no amount of encouraging him to get home sooner seemed to help. Finally, in desperation, the boy’s father sat him down and said: “The next time you come home late from school you are going to be given bread and water for your supper - and nothing else. Is that perfectly clear son?” The boy looked straight into his father’s eyes and nodded. He understood perfectly. A few days later the boy came home even later than usual. As promised, that night, when they sat down together at the table there was a single slice of bread on the boy’s plate and a glass of water alongside. His parent’s plates were full of food. The father waited for the full impact to sink in, then, quietly took the boy’s plate and placed it in front of himself, and gave his plate to the boy. The boy understood what his father was doing. His father was taking upon himself the punishment that he, the boy, had brought upon himself by his own poor behaviour. The lesson taught by his dad had a profound impact on the boy. Years later he recalled the incident and said: “All my life I’ve known what God is like by what my father did  that night.” 

The boy’s story is a story about discovering that there are different ways of bringing about change in the world. Profound change can come from a place of humility and service, and doesn’t depend on dominance and force, but is brought about by the witness of one’s life and respect for the dignity of those we encounter. In many ways this is a counter cultural message, but nevertheless, one that we see repeated again and again in the gospels. 

In our gospel today (Mark 10:35-45) we see this play out when Jesus challenges the thinking of James and John when they request a seat at his right and left, when he enters the Kingdom. Somehow, their request reveals how they have failed to understand the teaching of Jesus, how little impact his example and his day to day living has had on their lives! Maybe the same happens to us!!

By telling us this story, Mark knows what you and I know: that we are prone to the same desire for privilege and protected status. We want a Jesus who will give us what we want, a Lord who can shower a little power on us, a Saviour who can make us better than we are. Of course when we long for those things we have missed the point that great leadership, from a Christian perspective, doesn’t come from where one sits, but rather has to do with how one serves. 

If we look at the some of the enduring examples of greatness in the world in recent time, we see that greatness is not about position or material power, but about men and women who understood that leadership, service and personal sacrifice are inextricably linked. Think of Fr Maximillian Kolby  a Polish Franciscan friar who actively worked to hide Jews from the Nazis during the second World War. In 1941, Kolbe volunteered to take the place of a stranger who was going to be starved to death (along with nine others) at the concentration in Auschwitz. After two weeks, Kolbe was the last remaining survivor when the guards executed him with a lethal injection of carbolic acid. Think of someone like Beethoven who was a master composer, not just because he was a gifted man, but because he struggled and sacrificed many hours to find just the right note. 

Think of Mother Teresa, a great woman, who gave up the security of her convent life to serve the poorest of the poor. 

Think of Mahatma Gandhi, who will be remembered as a great man because he worked for freedom for his people and died practicing non-violence as a form of protest. All of these people, and many more, worked to make the world a better place, often at significant personal sacrifice. 

So, when James and John ask Jesus for the privilege of sitting at his right and his left, Jesus asks them “Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?” He knows well that if they truly want to journey all the way with him, that there is much that is going to be asked of them. They are going to have to give of themselves, to sacrifice their comfort and their security, and possibly their lives if they are going to be faithful to the life that Jesus is proposing. Jesus himself ended up on the cross! Why should the life of any of his followers be any different? 

Bringing about change in society that reflects the values of God and God’s kingdom starts with personal change and is sure to find resistance in a world where power and status are seen as the measure of a person’s worth. For Jesus, such transformation means putting one’s gifts at the disposal of others. It involves personal sacrifice and humility where one is genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of a brother or sister. 
When power and authority are used in selfish ways, for personal gain, pleasure or advantage, instead of on behalf of others, we cease to be Christian, and become “like the leaders of the Gentiles” where self-interest is the order of the day. 

So today, as we gather here, what might these scriptures be asking of us? To look again at how we live? To ask ourselves if we live lives of service and humility or if we are more like the ‘gentile leaders’ who lord it over others? By saying yes to Christ in Baptism, we have made a commitment to a different way in the world. Are we faithful to that commitment, or does something need to change?  And so this morning, as we gather here, what might the spirit be asking of us? Do we truly live from a Christian place in our lives, or are we more inclined to live by the values of the world?

2021/10/24, 14:16 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 29th Sunday, Cycle B – World Mission Sunday - Fr Jerry Browne 

There is a story told about an old man who spent his life planting small fruit trees. One day a young boy asked him “when will these trees bear fruit”? The old man replied “Oh, probably many years after I am gone from this earth”. So, the boy asked him “why plant trees when you won’t be around to enjoy the fruits?” The old man replied “When I came into this world, I found that there were fruit trees here before me. I enjoyed the fruits from those trees. Now I plant these fruit trees for those who will come after me, just as others planted the fruit trees that I enjoyed, before I was born.” 

The old man was both wise and grateful. Wise in recognising that everything that we have in this world is a gift that we have received, whether it be a gift of creation, inheritance, education, opportunity or faith – all of it is gift – and it is ours only for now, because one day we will leave it all behind us. The old man’s actions of planting trees for the next generation is a gesture of gratitude and a sign that he truly appreciates the gift he has received and been able to enjoy. Through his willingness to ‘give back’ the next generation will also be able to derive pleasure from the fruits of the trees that he has planted. 

Today we celebrate World Mission Sunday. As we do so we take time to give thanks for the gift of faith that we have received and to remember the women and men who went before us and were gracious enough to share their faith with us, so that we might come to know Christ. We think also of the generations who come after us and, just like the old man in the story, take time to reflect on what our legacy in faith will be. 

Every year, as we celebrate World Mission Day, Pope Francis draws our attention to the missionary mandate that each of us has personally received through our baptism. In 2019 he wrote “I am a mission, always; you are a mission, always; every baptized man and woman is a mission. People in love never stand still: they are drawn out of themselves; they are attracted and attract others in turn; they give themselves to others and build relationships that are life-giving. As far as God’s love is concerned, no one is useless or insignificant. Each of us is a mission to the world, for each of us is the fruit of God’s love.” 

In other words, though our baptism, each one of us shares in the work that Jesus came to share with us. The theme of the Pope’s 2020 message was “Here am I Lord, send me” (Isaiah 6:8). In that message he recalled the words of the prophet Isaiah who responded to the Lord’s call with bravery and enthusiasm, just as we are called to respond to the call that we receive in our baptism. 

This year, the theme of World Mission Sunday is taken from the Acts of the Apostles and declares “We cannot but speak about what we have seen and heard” (Acts 4:20). In other words, we cannot but speak about our faith. If we have really experience the power of God’s love in our life, how can we keep it to ourselves, surely it just bursts out of us, it is something that we have to share. That is what mission is about! It is about our willingness to share our faith in Christ, and the difference that our faith has made in our life, and to do that in a world where our faith might be ridiculed because so many are blind to God’s presence. 

In today’s gospel, (Mark 10:46-52) we hear the story of the healing of the blind Bartimaeus. This is not just a simple miracle story, but is really a story about a man who comes to faith in Jesus in spite of his physical blindness. It is the story of a man who moves out of darkness and isolation as he comes to recognise that there is something special about Jesus, and in doing so, he is willing to put his trust and faith in him. 

This is a story with many layers and much symbolism. We see the movement from darkness to light and from blindness to sight. We also see the importance of tenacity in our faith! When Bartimaeus first cries out to the Lord, his appeal is rebuked by the people around him, but he cried all the louder. What do we do when someone scorns our faith – do we just keep silent, or do we press on and continue to give witness to the Lord in our life?

Perhaps one of the most important aspects of this story however is the movement from a passive state to an active one. The story begins with Bartimaeus sitting passively by the side of the road  and ends with Bartimaeus actively following Jesus along the way. That’s what mission is, actively giving witness to the presence of Christ in our lives. 

The early Christians called themselves “people of the way”. They understood that following Jesus meant letting go of an old way of life and embracing ‘the way’ of Jesus. Being a follower of the way means turning to Jesus to heal us of our blindness, our prejudices, our selfishness, our brokenness, our ambitions, all the things that prevent us from being all that we can be. It means consciously letting go of whatever holds us back. The story tells us that Bartimaeus sprang up and went to Jesus. This is significant and symbolises leaving our old way behind. Bartimaeus left everything, his one possession - his cloak. His cloak was his bed, his coat, his warmth, his security, all that he had to depended on. That is exactly what Mark wants us to understand. Let go of what you think is critical and important and  necessary and risk all, as you give your life to Jesus.

Finally Mark lets us know that Bartimaeus is a beggar with no resources of his own, nothing to offer the Lord. The only thing he has to offer is his poverty, and his faith in Jesus. Mark wants us to know that it is okay to come to Jesus as we are, in our poverty of spirit, in our brokenness, in our smallness, because he will welcome us and gives us more than we could ever imagine. 

So what might our Scriptures be saying to us today? As we celebrate World Mission Sunday what is it in your life that needs to change, do we need to trust in the Lord? Do you need to covercome the voices of those who scorn your faith? Is there something that you need to let go of? Are you willing to share our faith with others? Does your love for Jesus cause you to speak of what you have seen and heard and what Christ means to you? 

As we celebrate this Mission Sunday, let us take a moment to look again at how we respond to the Mission that we have been given and how we share the love of Christ in the world.

2021/10/31, 12:28 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 31st Sunday, Cycle B - Fr Jerry Browne

I came across a story recently that really got me thinking. It is the story of a rabbi who was teaching a class and asked his students "Which act of charity (which act of love) is higher - giving out of obligation or giving from the heart?"  What do you think? How would you answer that question? 

Many of the students said ’giving from the heart’ After he got some responses the Rabbi said "Giving from the heart is a wonderful thing. It is a very high act and should never be underestimated. But there is something much more important that’s happens when somebody gives charity out of obligation.” 

Think about it for a moment. When I give from the heart it is my personal response to a given situation. Such charity comes easier, because somehow, we have discerned that our charity / our love is deserved. Often, such giving brings a sense of self-gratification – we are pleased with our generosity! However, when we give out of obligation, when we give at a moment that every part of us is yelling ‘no’ for one reason or another - perhaps we judge that the person that we are called to help or forgive is undeserving, because of something that he or she has done, or that the one we are helping just keeps coming back for more – and we wonder how long we can keep giving, or we judge that the person who is begging for money will use the money we give to buy alcohol, or any of the hundreds of reasons we use to avoid giving charity – in those moments it is our ego, our inclination to judge, and our limited thinking that dominates our decision making process. It is in that moment that the higher call to love unconditionally confronts our prejudices and obliges us to give / to love simply because it is the right thing to do. 

When we cooperate with that higher calling we allow ourselves to become the vehicles through which God’s love flows. Love like that isn’t easy – it is a moment when we have to ‘get out of the way’ – in other words to suspend our judgements – and allow God’s love to be known. When we do that, we not only help to make the world a better place, but we also discover that as the love flows through us, we too are healed.

In our gospel today (Mark 12:28) when Jesus is asked which is the greatest of the commandments he replies "The first is this: Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God is Lord alone! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. The second is this: You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” When Jesus responds to the question of the scribe, he is making it clear that love is at the heart of both our human and spiritual relationships. It isn’t something that can be measured or calculated, but requires an openness that allows the other to be who they are and not who we want them to be. 

Thomas Merton, one of the great spiritual writers in modern times, wrote “The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them.” He goes on to say “Our job is to love others without stopping to inquire whether or not they are worthy. That is not our business and, in fact, it is nobody's business. What we are asked to do is to love, and this love itself will render both ourselves and our neighbours worthy.”

In order to truly love, we have to let go of all the barriers to love that we carry withing us. Anything in our life that doesn’t look like compassion or mercy or empathy is a barrier to love. Things like prejudice, hatred, vengeance, indifference, jealousy, judgements and envy all prevent us from loving and will gradually destroy not only our relationships, but will  eventually eat us away and end up causing us to become sick. Love on the other hand heals us and frees us to be who we are truly meant to be. 

There is a story about a man who had a huge boulder in his front yard. He grew weary of this big, unattractive stone in the centre of his lawn, so he decided to take advantage of it and turn it into an object of art. He went to work on it with hammer and chisel, and chipped away at the huge boulder until it became a beautiful stone elephant. When he finished a neighbour asked, "How did you ever carve such a marvellous likeness of an elephant?" The man answered, "I just chipped away everything that didn't look like an elephant!" 

In affirming the great commandment to love God, and reminding us that love of God is reflected in the way we love our neighbour and ourself, Jesus places love squarely at the centre of our life and doesn’t leave any room for anything that doesn't look like love.

And so maybe the challenge for us this week is to chip away at the things in our life that don’t look like love, in order to truly become the people that God has called us to be.

2021/11/07, 14:57 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – All Saints - B, 2021 

Thomas Merton was one of the best known Catholic authors of the twentieth century. Shortly after he became a Catholic in the late 1930s, he was walking down the street with a Jewish friend by the name of Robert Lax. Lax asked Merton what he wanted to be, now that he was Catholic. Merton replied that he didn’t know - that he simply wanted to be a good Catholic. Lax turned to his friend and said, “What you should say is that you want to be a saint!” Merton was taken aback by his friends comment and asked “How do you expect me to be a saint?” Lax replied, “All that is necessary to be a saint is to want to be one. Don’t you believe that God will make you what He created you to be, if you consent to let Him do it? All you have is to desire it.”

Today we celebrate the feast of All Saints. It is a feast that celebrates who we are in Christ. Jesus’ whole life and ministry was about helping people to understand more fully the potential that lies within us. In John’s Gospel (John 10:10) he declared “I have come that you might have life and have it in abundance.” In his daily encounters with people, Jesus shows us what it is to be truly human and helps us to understand that our lives are not ours alone, but are interwoven emotionally, physically and spiritually with others and with God. We belong to something that is bigger than ourselves, something that is not easy to explain or describe, but is nevertheless real.

As Catholics and Christians we recognise this reality when we speak about the ‘communion of saints’, a concept that we profess in the creed, and strive to live in reality. The “communion of saints’ reminds us that we are not alone, that we belong to each other, that the women and men of faith who have trod the path of life before us continue to accompany us even as they occupy a spiritual realm! We in turn  need to be there for each other now, as we strive to live as people of God. 

Of course the saints were not all perfect people to begin with. They came to holiness as they came to know Christ. Think of St Augustine for example. In his early years, Augustine lived a rather promiscuous and self-indulgent life. He famously prayed “Lord save me, but not just yet!” He eventually turned his life around and went on to become one of the greatest Christian influences in church history. It’s what Augustine, and others like him, did with Christ’s help that made them saints not what they got up to prior to accepting that help. That same dynamic is true for us also: with Christ’s grace we can attain holiness. Our past is not the measure of who we are, once we are willing to turn to Christ. 

Journeying towards holiness is probably not the way that many of us would describe our lives. It is as if being ‘holy’ is something that is beyond us, something that is reserved for a special few, or something that cuts us off from a normal life. The opposite in fact is true. To grow in holiness simply means to grow into the person that I am meant to be. It means trusting that we are more than our weaknesses and failures and instead allowing the hidden goodness and beauty that God has placed within us to come out. That journey starts with the realization that God loves me as I am. The saints were people who believed the Good News of God’s unconditional love. As they trusted in God’s love, they found their lives changing, not overnight, but through a gradual process of growth which didn’t rule out further falls. In some cases it takes longer than others, but eventually, as we allow ourselves to be healed by God’s love, we begin to discover the truth of who we are meant to be. 

The journey to holiness begins with a desire to experience a fuller life and an acknowledgement that we can’t do it alone. It includes the rich tapestry of our lives, our home and family, our work and social environment, our spiritual exercises, everything that constitutes our existence. For it is in these ordinary places that we must choose, with the help of God’s grace, to be the person that God is calling us to be. It is in all these places that we must hunger and thirst for righteousness, that we must strive to act with a pure and undivided heart, that we must grieve for the world’s injustice, and live rather as peacemakers who have come to know the mercy of God. 

The call to holiness doesn’t mean that we become people who can be taken advantage of easily. On the contrary, it means that we have the strength to resist greed and selfishness, the quest for power and domination, and that we recognise instead that we are in this together; that how I live affects those around me. It means that we are willing to live in a way that acknowledges and honours the fact that we belong to each other, because we belong to Christ. So today as we gather here, what might the scriptures and this feast day be asking of you? To be more mindful of the impact of my life on others? To be more open to the guidance of the Holy Spirit in my life? Let us pray for the strength and the courage to be more faithful to our baptismal calling so that we can truly become the people God calls us to be.

Mark link tells a story about a hardened criminal who in the early 1900s seemed destined to spend his life behind bars. Everyone, including the man himself, believed that he was beyond rehabilitation. He had fallen into such despair that he had lost all hope and had become mean and dispirited. His behaviour was violent, which meant that he was often sent to solitary confinement to a cell that was known as “the hole.” One day while in “the hole” he was lying on the cold cement floor doing sit-ups when he noticed that something was wedged into the back corner of the cell, under the platform that he slept on. He decided to crawl under the bunk and see if he could retrieve the object. It was then that he discovered that it was in fact a copy of the New Testament. 

With nothing else to do the inmate began to read the book. He had always been a strong and powerful man, with no fear, but used his energy in violent ways. As he read the scriptures he began to wonder what would have happened to him if he had used his power and energy for good rather than evil. During his time in ‘the hole’, he began thinking: “Why did God create me? Why did God create someone who would end up behind bars? Why did God create someone who would die to goodness and love and be buried in a tomb of evil and hate in a prison cell?” As he reflected on his life a surprising thought entered the man’s mind. It suddenly struck him that the greatest event in history began in a tomb - a tomb just as secure and guarded as his cell. That event, of course was the resurrection of Jesus. The question then came to him “what if what happened to Jesus could happen to me too?” What if, just like Jesus, he could, in a sense “rise from the dead” and begin to live a new life? 

As these thoughts went through his mind, he felt something stirring inside of him, the possibility that there might be more for his life than violence and despair. Then he asked Jesus to come to him and raise him to a new life, to re-create a hardened criminal into a new person. Incredibly, that was when his life changed – it was a moment of transformation. What happened to Jesus in the tomb happened to the prisoner in his tomb, in “the hole.” The man’s name was Starr Dailey, who after his release from prison became one of the pioneers of prison reform in the United States and went on to write a number of books – his first being  ‘Love Can Open Prison Doors’

The incredible way in which God’s works in seemingly hopeless and desperate situations is the subject of our scripture readings today. At first the readings seem gloomy and full of despair, but they are in fact meant to be reassuring and are given not to incite fear but rather to invite reflection on the faithfulness of God. 

When Mark wrote his Gospel about 30 to 40 years after the death of Jesus, the Christians living in Rome were experiencing vicious persecution by the Romans during the reign of the emperor Nero (about 64 A.D.). In the midst of this political turmoil and persecution, many began to despair and wonder “where is God in all of this’?, and began to wonder if God had in fact abandoned them.  

Mark answers these concerns when he quotes a familiar text from Daniel, (Mark 13: 24-32) written a hundred years earlier, where the prophet assured the people that God is faithful. The reassuring message was that evil would be overcome. Daniel saw the eventual victory of good personified in a figure he called the Son of Man

For Mark, the Son of Man came in power and great glory when Jesus deliberately took flesh and lived a life that changed the world. From the birth of Jesus, life would never be the same again. Mark wanted to remind the Christian Community that the change that Jesus brought about didn’t come easy. In fact Jesus himself went through sever pain, persecution and rejection, and was eventually crucified for crimes that he didn’t commit. But even on the cross, Jesus’ resolve to give witness to God’s love was unshaken, as he offered forgiveness to the very people who murdered him. Mark wanted the Christians in Rome, and us, to understand that the Christian life doesn’t spare us from the trials and tribulations of life, and to remind us that even as we go through those difficulties, that we are not alone – the love of God that raised Jesus from the dead is with us. 

As Christians we need to look for the signs of God’s presence among us, even in the midst of our despair. As Christians we keep hope alive for others when we choose to live lives of love. Nothing that we do is insignificant.  Our interactions with each other, our practical respect for the human dignity of those we meet; our openness of heart and mind when we encounter people who are different from us; our words of encouragement when someone is facing a difficult situation; the way we treat the poor and underprivileged; our care for the environment; all makes a difference and gives witness to God’s care and love in the here and now. The readings challenge us to look at life differently... not with eyes of despair but with eyes of hope as we look for the glimmer of light that points towards the resurrection. Because in that glimmer of light there is power to transform our lives. 

And so this morning as we gather here, we take a moment again to reflect on our lives and to look at our own situation. When we find ourselves in moments of trial, do we give up? Do we give in to despair? Like Starr Daily, do we turn in on ourselves and start living from place of despair with bitterness and hate shaping our life, or do we look for the resurrection, trusting that we are not alone, that God is with us to help us no matter what the situation might be?

2021/11/21, 11:50 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Christ the King B - 2021

Have you ever seen the movie “In the Line of Fire”? In the movie, Clint Eastwood plays the role of Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan. Horrigan had protected the life of the President for more than three decades, but he was haunted by the memory of what had happened thirty years before. Horrigan was a young agent assigned to protect  President Kennedy on that fateful November day in Dallas in 1963. When the assassin fired, Horrigan froze in shock. For thirty years afterward, he wrestled with the ultimate question for a Secret Service agent: Can I take a bullet for the President? In the climax of the movie, Horrigan does what he had been unable to do earlier: he throws himself into the path of an assassin’s bullet to save the President. 

Secret Service agents are willing to do such a thing because they believe the President is so valuable to the country that he is worth dying for. 

At Calvary, 2000 years ago, that scene was reversed. The most important person that ever lived, the King of the Universe, Jesus, the Christ, takes our place so that we might be saved, that we might be redeemed from our sin and given the gift of eternal life. As Christ hangs on the cross, we see how valuable we are to God when his own son is willing to take our place. 

Today we celebrate the Feast of Christ the King. As we do so, we celebrate the truth that God so loved the World that he sent his only son into the world – not to condemn the world, but that through him the world might be saved. (John 3:17) 

This is the truth that Jesus speaks about in the Gospel today (John 18:33-37). He came to bring about a Kingdom not of this world - but a Kingdom of love and mercy – a Kingdom where God’s love is the measure of every life. A Kingdom where each individual is seen for who he or she is and not by the labels that society places upon us. This gift of love isn’t a favour - it isn’t something that we earn - it is grace, undeserved, yet freely given. 

This undeserved grace is God’s love and goodness that comes looking for us when we have nothing to offer but our weaknesses, our tantrums, our insults, our small mindedness, or petty hates and prejudices. It is the irrational actions of a shepherd who puts ninety-nine sheep at risk when he goes looking for the one sheep that has wandered off (Luke 15:1 – 7). It’s the love of a father who runs out to welcome home a wayward son after he shamelessly squandered his inheritance on a life of self-indulgence and only comes home because he has nowhere else to go (Luke 15:11 – 32). It is a one-way love that calls us into the kingdom not because we have been good, but because God has chosen us – chosen you and me - and made us his own. 

Our response, somehow, must be to allow God’s power to heal us, to draw on the strength of Christ who has power over all creation. This feast day invites us to turn to Christ when things are not going well in our life, to refuse to be ruled by fear and worry or to give in to despair. Instead, emboldened by the Holy Spirit, we must look for the signs of hope that are always present, even in our despair, the signs of light that are always to be found, even in darkness, and the opportunities for love, that are always present even in moments of vulnerability.

As a community of faith too, we must have the courage to show a different way of life to the world around us. We live in a country that is deeply divided, that is often ruled by greed, corruption and self-interest. We have an opportunity, as a community of faith, to live lives that give witness to a different reality, lives that embody the inclusive Kingdom vision of Jesus; lives that are rooted in justice, compassion, solidarity, service and love. Only by living that vision fully as the Body of Christ, can we become a beacon of hope in a world that has lost direction, a world that blindly clamours after power and wealth in an attempt to fill the emptiness, and sooth the pain, that inevitably arise when relationships are sacrificed on the altar of greed and self-interest. 

So today as we gather here, what might the Holy Spirit be asking of us? To grow as disciples of Christ the King by bearing witness to the way of truth and love that Jesus embodied? To be self-giving in a world that often promotes self-interest? To recommit to living as people of God in a world that has lost its way? 

We can show the world a different way, when we put Christ at the centre of our lives, and we strive to live as people of God. 

So today, let us recommit to our baptismal commitment. Let us strive to give witness to the truth of Christ in our daily lives as we draw on the power of his love.

2021/11/28, 17:30 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 1st Sunday Advent C 2021

Years ago, my grandfather related a story about his time working in New York. He recalled, how one morning he slept late and consequently was running late for work. He quickly washed and ran to the bus stop. As he waited for the bus, he anxiously paced up and down as he kept looking to see when the bus might be coming. After some time, he turned to a woman who was also waiting for the bus and remarked “The busses are slow this morning.” The woman looked at him and said “No son, I think you are just ‘waiting too fast”! I suppose there have been moments in all of our lives when we have been “‘wating too fast”, when we get anxious and want immediate results. When that happens in your life, what do you do? Panic?

When things are not going your way – when you are in an anxious moment? When life is hard or when your world seems to be falling apart, what do you do? Maybe you marriage is struggling or a friend has betrayed you. Maybe you have a family member that is sick or death has visited your home. Maybe you hear the news that there is yet another variant to the corona virus and more restrictions are imposed; what do you do then? In such situation it is easy to panic or to give in to despair, to focus on the challenges that we are experiencing and somehow imagine that they have become the measure of our lives, that we will never get out from under this cloud that follows us around - that we will never see happiness or joy again. Life is not easy in such situations, and we sometimes wonder if our lives will ever be normal again, if we will ever see the light again?

In our gospel today (Luke 21: 25-28, 34-36) we witness some of that same turmoil, but on a global scale. Luke is writing for a community that is struggling to stay faithful, a community who has been being persecuted for their belief in Christ. He urges his listeners not to give in to despair, not to allow the darkness to overwhelm their lives. Part of the evangelists role is help people to recognise that the place that they are in their life right now, is not the end of the story. Things changed to get us to the place that we are now, and things will change again and life will get better. That’s not always easy to see, especially when we are in the midst of the storm, but change will come again. In such situations it is easy to be overwhelmed, to lose our focus, to miss all the good that is happening, while we are busy paying attention to all that is wrong. It is like having a toothache. All you can focus on is the pain in your mouth, and your miss all the rest that is happening around you – you can see no good, because the pain is overwhelming. 

That is why our gospel today is so important. The powerful signs that it speaks of, the roaring of the seas and the turmoil in the heavens, the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory, are not meant to scare us, but to encourage us. These signs in the sky are the scripture’s way of saying that our God is powerful and our God is active. 
Luke is telling us that Christ comes to us in the midst of our turmoil and confusion, not only once the storm has passed and all seems well again. This is a really important message to hold on to – that Christ is with us in powerful ways, even when all seems lost. It is important because all too often it is only when the storm has calmed that we recognise Christ, when everyone in our family is healthy, when our job is secure, when all is going well at school, when our relationships are strong. In those time it is easy to say, “Look God has blessed us.” But, when things fall apart, when we start to fear the future, when the feeling of love has vanished, then we begin to say, “Where is God? Why has Christ abandoned us?”

Today’s gospel invites us to look again. Jesus urges us to “Be vigilant at all times,” “Stand erect,” “Raise your heads,” “Beware that your hearts do not become drowsy.” 

In other words to believe that Christ is present in every situation, no matter how painful. He is there as we sit at home in the midst of a lockdown. He is there when we put our lives back together after a painful divorce. He is there when we wake up alone and remember our grief and pain as we mourn the loss of a loved one. He is there when our children disappoint us and take the wrong path. He is there when our loved ones are far away, and all we can do is hope that they are okay. 

So this advent, and indeed throughout the year, if you find yourself struggling to make sense of life, do not conclude that Christ has forgotten you. He is standing at your side in glory. His presence is mysterious for sure, and often difficult to discern, but he is there. Look for him! 

And so, as we come together on this first Sunday of Advent, what might the Holy Spirit be saying to you today? Be Strong? Stand erect? Raise your head? Do not let your heart become drowsy – your Lord is close at hand? Look Again?

2021/12/05, 14:02 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 2nd Sunday Advent C 2021 – Fr Jerry Browne 

A teacher decided to honour each of the students in her Senior class at high school by telling them what a difference each of them had made. First, she told each of them how they had made a difference to her and the class. Then she presented each of them with a blue ribbon imprinted with gold letters that read, “Who I Am Makes a Difference.” She also gave each of the students three more ribbons and instructed them to go out and spread this acknowledgment ceremony. 

A few days later, a junior executive, who had received one of the ribbons from a friend connected to the school, went in to see his boss, who had been noted as being kind of a grouchy fellow. He sat his boss down and told him that he deeply admired him for being a creative genius. The boss seemed very surprised. The junior executive asked him if he would accept the gift of the blue ribbon. The boss agreed, so he took the ribbon and placed it right on his boss’s jacket above his heart. As he left, he said, “Would you take this extra ribbon and pass it on by honouring somebody else?” 

That night the boss came home to his 14-year-old son and sat him down and said to him, “The most incredible thing happened to me today. I was in my office and one of the junior executives came in and told me he admired me and gave me a blue ribbon for being a creative genius. He gave me an extra ribbon and asked me to find somebody else to honour. As I was driving home tonight, I started thinking about whom I would honour with this ribbon and I thought about you. I want to honour you. My days are really hectic and when I come home, I don’t pay a lot of attention to you. Tonight, I just wanted to let you know that you do make a difference to me. Besides your mother, you are the most important person in my life. You’re a great kid and I love you!” The startled boy started to sob and sob, and he couldn’t stop crying. He looked up at his father and said through his tears, “I was planning on committing suicide tomorrow, Dad, because I didn’t think you loved me. Now I know you care. This is the happiest day I’ve known.” The boss went back to work a changed man. He was no longer a grouch but made sure to let all his employees know that they made a difference. And the young boy and his classmates learned a valuable lesson.

All of our readings today offer hope and encouragement and take time to let people know that they make a difference. In the first reading (Baruch 5:1-9) the prophet Baruch asks people to take off the robe of mourning and misery; And to put on the splendour of glory from God forever: to wrap themselves in the cloak of justice from God, to bear on their heads the mitre that displays the glory of the eternal name. In other words Baruch is saying “remember who you are – who you are meant to be - don’t lose hope in the future – things will get better. 

In his letter to the Philippians (Philippians 1:4-6, 8-11), Paul takes a similar line – he compliments the people for helping him in his work and tells them that he loves them very much – and invites them to prepare for that day when they will reach perfect goodness. 

In the gospel (Luke 3:1-6) we meet John the Baptist travelling around the Jordan district announcing the possibility of salvation for all. He acknowledges that sin is part of our lives, but makes it clear that we have the potential to do better. 

All the readings have a marvellous insight – people begin to change when they are encouraged to see the best in  themselves – not when they are asked to dwell with the worst. It is very easy to point out the negative in someone and just leave it. If we truly want to help that person we must also help them to see the good in themselves. 

So how are we going to make the word of God real in our lives this week. Someone once said that great opportunities to help others seldom come – but small ones surround us every day. 

Maybe it means making friends with someone you are not getting along with; or telling someone how they make difference in your life; or picking up the phone and chatting with someone you have not chatted with in a long time. It takes only a few minutes to do something that is kind – but the effects can leave a lasting impression. 

Let us make a commitment to look for opportunities to bring the light of Christ into the world this week. Someone is waiting for that word of encouragement  - by giving it, you can make all the difference.

2021/12/12, 13:06 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 3rd Sunday Advent C 2021

Today we celebrate the Third Sunday of Advent – a day that is also known as _Gaudete_ _Sunday_ or Rejoice Sunday. “_Gaudete_” is Latin for "_Rejoice_!" It comes from the first word of today's Second Reading from St. Paul's Letter to the Philippians (Philippians 4:4-17). 

When Paul, who is in prison, writes to the community at Philippi, he encourages them to ‘_Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say rejoice_’ In the reading he reminds us that God is near, and urges us to be joyful and generous in our  relationships with one another, to pray confidently to God, and not to be anxious about our lives. Great advice don’t you think – how often anxiety robs us of the joy of life. Someone once said  “_Anxiety is a thin stream of fear trickling through the mind. If encouraged, it cuts a channel into which all other thoughts are drained._” 

In the first reading the prophet Zephaniah (Zephaniah 3:14-18) is speaking to a people who have been burdened with war, destruction, and displacement. Their lives have been assaulted, and their hopes have been dashed. Zephaniah invites his listeners to put their trust in the Lord and not to allow their situation to cause them to despair. “_Fear not, O Zion_” he says, “_be not _discouraged_! _The Lord, your God, is in your midst._”_ Because he is writing for a people who have at times turned their back on God, Zephaniah’s words are particularly encouraging as he assured them, and us, that  “_the Lord has removed the judgment against you he has turned away your enemies_.” In other words, let not your past be the source of your anxiety, new beginnings are always possible.
Thanks 
The Gospel scene for today (Luke 3:10-18) strikes a more sober tone. It portrays John the Baptist urging the crowds to change their way of life and to live justly and generously. Speaking in simple language to the crowds, the soldiers, the tax collectors, and us as well, John outlines what is necessary to live a life of charity. He highlights honesty and social justice as key ingredients in our dealings with one another, and particularly with the vulnerable in our society. These are the values that will ultimately bring true joy.

It is easy to imagine a situation where someone who is a follower of Christ might try to make excuses for themselves, for not following all the precepts of the gospel. For example, someone might say: “but I work for the government, and everyone in my team takes a ‘kick back’ so I have to go along with what the others do in order to keep my job”; or “I am poor, and my boss doesn’t pay me enough, so I am only taking what I deserve” or “I am … in a loveless marriage … a refugee … from a disadvantaged background … or any of the myriad of excuses that we make to excuse our behaviour! 

John the Baptist is very clear, that none of us, regardless of our situation, is  exempted from obeying the commandments and from practicing charity with honesty and justice. 

There is a very good reason for doing this, and it’s very simple. When we give to others, we give to ourselves as well! Think about it! Often when we choose to help the poor, feed the hungry or visit the sick, we do so because we think they need it, which of course they do. But we often forget that those acts of charity are actions that we also need. 

The reality is that when we give ourselves to others in love, when we learn to let go of our greed, or our desire to possess, or any of the narratives that have fearfully held us captive, we begin to live more fully as the people God wants us to be. 

Our fears and our anxieties begin to diminish as we become more grounded in the interconnection of our human  reality and we begin to trust again. It is then that we discover that our fears and anxieties ultimately come from isolation and disconnection. As we move out of the head, the home of worry, anxiety, and self-preservations,  we discover a richer way of living, a way of living that brings deeper joy, a joy that cannot be taken away. We begin to realise that we were never meant to walk this path alone, but have a responsibility of care for our fellow travellers on the way. John the Baptist reminds us of this when he declares the Good News. It is for us to embrace it, or to continue to walk the path alone. 

I want to end with a quote from Jack Kornfield who said “In the end, just three things matter: How well we have lived. How well we have loved. How well we have learned to let go.”
2021/12/13, 07:44 - +27 82 851 5315: 📖 Matthew 28:20

‘And be sure of this: I (the Lord) am with you always, even to the end of the age.’

- There is never a moment that His presence is removed from us.
- In these final words, He reminds us that He is always with us.
- Trials will come and go, but His presence will abide forever.
- Even when things seem like they are falling apart, He remains with us.

2021/12/25, 16:35 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily Christmas - C 2021 

Down through the years it seems to me that we have taken the story of the birth of Christ and cleaned it up – made it more acceptable and comfortable. Think of the art that depicts the night that Jesus was born – or even a Christmas card that depicts the nativity scene. What do you see? A beautiful stable – with a lovely little baby boy with a perfect halo - lying a cute manger – angels floating on high - Mary and Joseph in clean clothes, humble sweet shepherds with well-scrubbed and properly groomed animals standing round - and richly dressed magi arriving with their fabulous gifts. The scene looks perfect – but that is far from the reality of the first Christmas.

Think about it! Joseph and Mary were poor peasants who were just looking for a place to find shelter. Think of the dust and sweat from the road and how weary they must have been. And then imagine giving birth in a cave – the lack of hygiene, the blood, the roughness of it all. And then having to put your baby in a manger – a feeding trough for animals. The whole thing was a mess – and yet the picture most of us have in our heads is the romantic notion of everything being perfect.

When we dress up the nativity scene – when we dress up Christmas - we are missing the whole point of the incarnation – we are missing the messiness of it all. We are missing the point that God didn’t choose to come in to a perfect world – but a very broken one. When God became flesh – when he took on our human condition – it is not because we were perfect – quit the opposite. God chose our human existence in spite of our flaws and limitations, our brokenness and sinfulness.

As such Christmas is a powerful sign of Gods desire to embrace our humanity. Jesus is the Word made flesh – who dwells among us – not among  some perfect people, but among us imperfect broken and sometimes unpleasant people. And that is the crux of the matter – none of us are worthy – none of us have any claim on salvation. None of us have earned our salvation. It is God’s gift given freely to each one of us  in Christ – not through our efforts, but through God’s unconditional Love. In the same way that none of us are worthy of salvation – so too none of us are beyond salvation – none of us are too far gone. Each of us has value and worth in God’s eyes – that is why this Christmas story begins in such a humble place. If Christ could be born in such a place – he can be born in my life too.

The one who was born into this world to save us made his bed in a manger - a feeding box for cattle. 

For Luke of course this detail of the feeding box is very significant. Jesus was born in Bethlehem – a word which means house of bread. He was born in a stable, and was laid in a manger. 

For Luke the symbolism is clear – Jesus came into the world to ease our hunger / to fill the emptiness, the longing within us for a personal relationship with God that is part of our human condition. It is the same Jesus, who later in John’s gospel says “I am the bread of Life – the one who comes to me will never be hungry, the one who believes in me will never thirst.  So, this morning as we gather here to celebrate the birth of Jesus, my prayer for each of us is that the Holy Spirit will help us to experience the unconditional love of God – the love that we see in the incarnation – and that that love might find its way into our hearts. And that there it might help us to see ourselves anew – as God sees us – as God values us.

May the blessing of the Christ child be with you and your family this Christmas and always.

Please pass this on even if you do not have kids in school. Parents should know about this drug.This is a new drug known as 'strawberry quick '.There is a very scary thing going on in the schools right now that we all need to be aware of.There is a type of crystal meth going around that looks like strawberry pop rocks (the candy that sizzles and 'pops' in your mouth). It also smells like strawberry and it is being handed out to kids in school yards. They are calling it strawberry meth or strawberry quick.Kids are ingesting this thinking that it is candy and being rushed off to the hospital in dire condition. It also comes in chocolate, peanut butter, cola, cherry, grape and orange.Please instruct your children not to accept candy from strangers and even not to accept candy that looks like this from a friend (who may have been given it and believed it is candy) and to take any that they may have to a teacher, principal, etc. immediately.Pass this email on to as many people as you can (even if they don't have kids) so that we can raise awareness and hopefully prevent any tragedies from occurring..!!

2022/01/23, 14:13 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 3rd Sunday C 2022

As many of you will know, many hotels place a bible in the hotel bedroom as a service to their guests. Some years ago, the Sanford Hotel in San Francisco decided to also add a dictionary for their guests. The hotel reported that in 15 years they never lost a bible, but in one month, after they started putting dictionaries in the rooms, 41 dictionaries disappeared. I am not sure if we can draw any solid conclusions from that report, but it certainly seems that people put more value on human words than they do on the Word of God.

Today we celebrate, the Third Sunday of the Year, also known, since 2019, as Sunday of the Word of God. The whole point of this celebration is to remind us of the claim that God’s word has on our lives.

Our Spiritual Ancestors understood that the Word had great power. In the Old Testament, the Hebrew phrase Debar Yahweh translates as Word of God, but has a much richer significance than how we use the word “word” in English. We often say that words are cheap, or that someone’s word is not worth much. It was different in the Jewish culture. For a Jew every word carries with it the mystery and the personality of the one who utters the word and brings about the purpose for which the word was uttered. Even more so when it comes to God’s word. So for example in the story of creation, when God speaks, the universe comes into existence. God said, “Let there be lights  … and it was so.” And again, God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds ...” And it was so. So once the word is uttered, it becomes the reality that it describes. 

In our Gospel today, we hear how Jesus takes up the scroll of the Prophet Isaiah and reads the text that we just heard (Luke 1:1-4; 4:14-21). “The spirit of the Lord has been given to me. He has sent me to bring the good news to the poor, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and to the blind new sight, and to set the downtrodden free – to proclaim the Lord’s year of favour…”, revolutionary words indeed. And then he concluded – Today, this text is been fulfilled in your hearing. These are powerful and stirring words that Jesus makes his own, and that will be enacted in his remarkable outpouring of compassion, mercy and healing as we here the story of his life unfold. Jesus is claiming that, in him, in the life that he lives, a new way of living is being ushered in. A way of life that brings liberation, a way of life that unshackles people from the burdens that society has placed upon them. A way of life that questions the status quo, and finds it wanting. 

Like many of us the Jews were trained to look to the future with hope. This can be a two edged sword. While it can help us to persevere in difficult times, it can also paralyze us from taking action now. A promise of a better tomorrow can be a very clever way of maintaining the status quo, keeping things the way they are today – holding on to control, preventing change. Some day in the future salvation will come – some day in the future liberation will be ours; some day in the future the messiah will come. Such promises help us to put up with the way things are now. So in reality, we spend our days, in charity and love, bandaging the wounds and ills of society, rather than address the root cause of the problem. Instead of dealing with the ills of society today, we bandage them, in the hope of a better tomorrow. 

When Jesus says, “Today the Scripture is fulfilled,” he turns a future hope into mission, into an assignment, claiming the beautiful poetry of Isaiah as his job description. 

Jesus asks his listeners to look to the future no longer – but to recognise that the time has come now – the time for God’s reign is now, the time to bring about a new world is now. The time to open our eyes to the injustices of society and the world is now. Not another day – not tomorrow – but today. We can’t put it off any longer.

Too often we look to tomorrow – I will make that call tomorrow – I will ask for forgiveness, tomorrow, I will visit my sick relative, tomorrow, I will ask why our education system is in tatters,  tomorrow. I will question the system that allows crime to control our society, tomorrow. Jesus tells us that now is the time – not tomorrow. We are invited to live in the present and to question the reality of our lives and the injustices that surround us, so that we can be liberated from them and liberate the world and society that we live in. 

So what is it that you have been putting off for tomorrow? What needs to be done today? Time slips by very quickly and suddenly we find ourselves looking back on our life and recognising that, perhaps, we have wasted many years.

There is power in God’s word, let us allow it to shape our mission in life, so that we might live more fully the life that God calls us to, and not waste the gift that he has given us. Jesus said, “I have come that you may have life and have it in abundance” (John 10:10) Now, not tomorrow. Is that the life that we are living now, or do we put off living until tomorrow.

2022/02/06, 14:05 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily - 5th Sunday C 2022 - Fr Jerry Browne 

You may have heard the story about the speaker who started off his talk by holding up a R100 note. In the room of 200 people, he asked, “Who would like this R100?” Hands started going up.

He said, “I am going to give this R100 to one of you but first, let me do this.” He proceeded to crumple the R100 into a ball. He then asked, “Who still wants it?” Still the hands were up in the air. “Well,” he replied, “What if I do this?” And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now all crumpled and dirty. “Now who still wants it?” Again the hands went up. 

Then he said “My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson about the R100. Even though the R100 was crumpled and dirty, it did not decrease in value. It was still worth R100. 
Many times, in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless. But no matter what has happened or what will happen, we will never lose our value in God’s eyes. To Him, dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, no matter how flawed and broken we might be, we are still priceless to Him.” 

All our scripture reading today tell this story – how God can use the most unlikely people to fulfil his plan for the world. In the first reading (Is 6:1-8) Isaiah protests his unworthiness when he realises that God is calling him to be a prophet. “What a wretched state I am in. I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips. He couldn’t imagine that God could possibly use him. In the second reading (1 Cor 15:12.16-20) Paul is amazed that God would call him, given his past and how he persecuted the Christian church. He says of himself, I am the least of the apostles, I hardly deserve the name apostle. And Peter, (Lk 6:17:20-26) when faced with the realisation of who Jesus is declared “Lord depart from me, for I am a sinful man.” All of them are aware of their shortfalls, their unworthiness to do God’s work, their limitations, their flaws, their sinfulness, and yet, all end up accepting God’s invitation and relying not on their own resources, but on God’s grace. The scriptures teach us that living a life of service for the Lord is not so much about our worthiness – or our gifts and talents, as much as it is about what God can do with us. 

Today, as always, God continues to ask “whom shall I send? Who will be my witnesses? 

In our baptism, we said yes to that call – we said yes to living a life of service, a life that reveals God’s love to the world. How are we doing with that? Do we live our faith with enthusiasm, are we proud to be called Christian? Does our life bring joy to the world, or do we get caught up in the pessimism of a society that has lost hope? Are we willing to stand up and be counted among the Lord’s followers? 

Sometimes, like Isaiah, and Peter and Paul, we are fearful. Fearful that people will make fun of us. Fearful that we are not good enough. Fearful about what others might say. Fearful, perhaps, that the Lord will ask too much of us - that we will have to give up too much - that we will have to live differently. And that is true. 

When Peter and his companions followed Jesus, they left everything. But the good news is that as we let go of our old way of life, as we let go of our fear and anxiety – and we trust in God, our lives are blessed with a new energy - a freedom that strengthens us and gives us new purpose and direction.  

For the most of us, answering the call will not mean leaving home and country, but it will mean living differently – it means being the hands and feet and mouth and eyes of Christ in our homes, our workplaces, and our schools and in our daily encounters. It means living justly, it means treating everyone we meet with dignity and respect, it means living our lives with enthusiasm and gratitude. It means that we accept the love of God in our lives and that we strive to give witness to that love in the world.  

So today, as we listen to God’s word, what is the spirit asking of you? Do you need to step up and become more actively involved in the life of the Church? Is the Lord calling you to a particular service? Is it time to come out of the hibernation that the past two years imposed on us, to once again play an active role in our community and in the world? Today the Lord has placed a call on you heart. How will you respond?

Some time back, the owners of a factory were having problems with some employees who were stealing. The company hired a security firm to help identify the people who were involved. They posted guards at all the exits, whose job it was to check each employee as they left for the day. They searched their clothing, bags and lunch boxes to make sure that they were not taking anything out. Every day one guy came by with a wheelbarrow full of junk. Every day they stopped him and searched through all of the junk and garbage that was in the wheelbarrow. It took several minutes every day to search through the junk. Every day the same thing – nothing but junk in the wheelbarrow. Finally, the security guard said, “Look, my friend, I know something is going on. Every day you come through here and all we find in the wheelbarrow is junk. If you promise to tell me exactly what is going on, I promise not to turn you in. Tell me what is going on.” The fellow grinned at the security guard and said, “I’m stealing wheelbarrows.”

Life isn’t always what it seems to be. Today’s gospel is certainly one of those times. (Luke 6:17, 20-26). In the gospel, Jesus addresses his disciples, and that’s important for us to remember, he is addressing his disciples, the people who had made the choice to follow him. As he addresses them he declares that they are blessed for being poor, hungry, denounced, even hated, and that that because of this, they will inherit God’s kingdom, while the rich, the ones whose bellies are full, the ones who are laughing now, the ones who are well spoken of, will, in time, lose all those privileges. What could Jesus be saying?  Does he mean that the poor and the hungry are blessed and that the rich are in trouble? Certainly, poverty doesn’t feel like a blessing, does it, and wealth does make life easier, but can we simply take this declaration at face value?

The key to understanding Luke’s beatitudes is found in two phrases. “The Kingdom of God” and “On account of the son of man.“ The gospel says, “Blessed are you poor, because yours is the Kingdom of God.” 

The Kingdom of God is Jesus’s way of describing God’s plan, God’s desire, God’s will for the world. In the various description of “God’s Kingdom” that we hear in Jesus’ parables, we see that the Kingdom is a place of peace, a place of equality and inclusion, a place where all are treated with respect and dignity, a place where good things are available in plenty. Such a vision describes a life that leads to true blessings and happiness, where we don’t need to defend our little stockpile, but where there is enough for all.

Jesus is very aware that the transformation of the world that is necessary to bring about these Kingdom values, will come at a high price. He encourages his disciples who have embraced the path towards transformation ‘on account of the Son of Man,” - in other words, because of him, - knowing that their decision will, inevitably, bring them poverty, hatred and humiliation. In choosing a way of living that is different from the prevailing values of family, cultural and society, the disciples will ultimately be rejected and ostracised by family and friends. The moment someone declared their faith in Christ they lost their right of inheritance, and the ability to trade in the community, so even if one was very rich with lots of land and possessions, it wouldn’t take long to be reduced to a state of poverty.

So, when Jesus says, “Blessed are you poor,” he is not saying that poverty is a blessing, but that the choice that the person has made, for God, even if it brings poverty, is a blessing. God’s plan for the world is to eliminate poverty, to eliminate hunger, to eliminate discrimination and injustice, and the fact that someone choose to be part of that plan, is a blessing, in the sense that they are choosing to join their  life to the mind of God. They are choosing to live their life according to God’s plan and vision for the world. 

When Jesus says, “Woe to you who are rich,” he is not saying that wealth is bad thing, but that people who have wealth can easily be lulled into a false sense of security and fail to see the injustices of the world around them. People who have all that they need, who are not hungry, who are joyful and content, might think that everything is just fine the way that it is – and it might be for them - but God’s vision says that it must be that way for everyone. It doesn’t make sense that we should live in a world where some people are so wealthy that they don’t know what to do with their money, while other people are going hungry.  There is something wrong with that scenario, that’s not God’s plan for the world. God’s plan is that everyone should be able to enjoy the benefits of God’s creation. 
So where does this leave us? It leaves us with a choice. We can choose to carry on as if Jesus had someone else in mind when he proclaimed this message, or we can make a choice to live a more inclusive life, where we remain conscious of our blessings, and our need to use them to bring about a more just society. 

We who seek a relationship with God are called to believe in God’s vision for the world, and to work with him to build God’s Kingdom, to instil God’s values in the here and now, on earth as it is in heaven, as we proclaim every time we pray the Our Father. So, as we gather today, what are these scriptures saying to you? They are a real challenge. They challenge the way we think, and they challenge the way we live. So how do we respond? Do we respond as if this word is for someone else, or is there something in our life that we need to change?

2022/02/20, 16:01 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 7th Sunday C 2022 – Fr Jerry Browne 

In the second half of 2006, two news stories made headline in a small community in Pennsylvania. The first was the tragic story of how a 32-year-old man by the name of Charles Roberts, entered a small one-roomed Amish schoolhouse in Nickel Mines. He ordered the teacher and the boys to leave, but kept the girls – ten of them - as hostages. 

When it became clear that he was preparing to shoot the girls, the oldest hostage, Marion Fischer, a 13-year-old, said, “Shoot me first and let the little ones go.” He opened fire on all of them, killing five and seriously injuring the other five. 

As police stormed the building, he shot himself.

The media descended on the small town, to report on yet another act of senseless violence. What the newspaper and television reporters discovered and relayed to the world, however, was to transform that awful story into a moment of grace.

The thing that surprised most people was how the Amish parents responded to this tragedy. They began by offering words of forgiveness to the family of Charles Roberts, the man who had killed their daughters. Later in the week the parents of Marion Fisher invited Roberts’ widow to their daughter’s funeral. Not only that, but the grieving Amish parents attended the killer’s burial, surprising his widow and children, not just by their presence, but by the way they greeted her and her children. 

There had been an outpouring of support for the Amish families, expressed in part by people making donations to the community. The Amish set aside part of this to support a fund for the Roberts’ family. 

That is an incredible story – and almost unbelievable! How can someone forgive such a heinous act? Why would they even try?

The reality of course, is that when we don’t forgive, we not only carry the hurt and pain with us, but we allow our ‘hurter’ to change the path of our life. This often happens unconsciously and occurs as the hurt turns to bitterness and the bitterness to hate. That toxic poison destroys not only ourselves, but seeps in to our relationships and destroys them also. So, when the Amish made the choice to forgive, they weren’t only thinking of the family of the man who killed their daughters, they also knew that without forgiveness, they too would become victims of his violence. 

In today’s gospel, when Jesus speaks to his disciples, those who have made a conscious decision to follow him, he challenges them to ‘love your enemies, do good to those who hate you’ and to ‘Forgive and you will be forgiven’ (Luke 6:27-38). This is a message that is counter cultural, a message to goes against every fiber of our being. It is, however, a message that is essential if we as human beings have any hope of living a life of freedom, a life that allows us to experience joy and happiness. 

Forgiveness is the key to our liberation and must not be confused with ‘being soft’ or ‘giving in’ or ‘condoning’ what has happened’ or ‘overlooking the injury that has occurred. Rather, it is first and foremost a personal act. It is about 'me' taking control of ‘my' life again and not allowing the actions of someone else determine its course - because that is exactly what happens if we don’t forgive. 

It’s not easy to forgive, and we can only do it with God’s grace. It is both a spiritual act and a conscious act. It involved seeking healing for our wound, and then making a conscious decision to let go of the pain. Forgiveness won’t change the fact than an injury has occurred, but it will change our future and our outlook on life. 

So today, as we listen to this word of God, what might the Holy Spirit be saying to us? Is there a hurt that I need to heal? Is there someone that I need to forgive, or is there someone that I need to ask forgiveness from?  I pray that you might receive the grace you need to free yourself from any hurt that you might be carrying, so that you may live freely again.

Susan Boyle is a Scottish singer who rose to fame in 2009 after she appeared as a contestant on the third series of Britain's Got Talent. When she entered the stage it was obvious from the reaction of the audience that they didn’t expect her do very well. She was a little over weight, her hair wasn’t very well styled, and when she spoke it seemed as if she might be a bit slow, mentally. Everybody expected her to fail. Then the music started, and Susan began to sing. From the moment she sang the first note, the audience was spell bound, and it soon became evident that this woman was more than her appearance! Susan went on the become a world famous singer and a symbol of encouragement for many who are judged because of their appearance. 

Have you ever noticed how easy it is to rush to judgement? More often than not it’s because we don’t take the time to find out what is happening in the other person’s life. Instead, we are inclined to label people based on the little that we see on the outside. For example, if a person is quiet and isn’t inclined to talk, we might think they are being rude. If someone cuts in front of us in traffic, we think they are reckless. If someone doesn’t make eye contact, we think they are hiding something. If someone is a street kid, we assume that they are untrustworthy. 

But what if we knew their stories? What if we could hear their thoughts? What if we had an opportunity to find out more about them, rather than rush to judgement. 

Mother Teresa would often say “If you judge people, you have no time to love them.”

So would it change things if we discovered that the reason someone is being quiet is because they have just heard that they are terminally ill, and they are trying not to burst into tears. Would it change things if we discovered that the reason the guy cut in front of us was because he just heard that his wife was in a car accident and he was rushing to the hospital. Would it change things if we discovered that the reason the guy refuses to make eye contact is because he was beaten daily as a child and he’s afraid of letting others see his pain?  Would it change things if we discovered that the street kid has no parents, but has two younger siblings at home that he is trying to feed? What if we knew all that? Would we react differently? Would we be more gracious, kind, and loving? Less judgmental, less harsh? 

Our gospel today (Luke 6:39-5) invites us to take a closer look at our own behaviour and attitude. It invites us to look into our own hearts. When Jesus asks, “Why do you notice the splinter in your brother’s eye, but do not perceive the wooden beam in your own?” and then goes on to say “Remove the wooden beam from your eye first; then you will see clearly to remove the splinter in your brother’s eye” he is asking us to take time to reflect on what is happening in our own life, because, very often, our tendency to judge others comes from a lack of self-awareness concerning our own faults and limitations. 

When we are not in touch with our own darkness, or our own anger, or our own pain, or our own aggression or our own limitations, or whatever it might be, we are more likely to project that emotion or judgement outwards on to the people that we meet in our day to day lives. More often than not, the thing that upsets us most about other people is something that we haven’t come to terms with in our own life. 

This morning, as we reflect on this Word of God, what might the scriptures be asking of us? Are we quick to judge or do we look for the bigger picture? Are we people who add joy to the world by affirming and encouraging others? Or are we people who add sorrow to world by constantly nagging and criticizing, and finding fault? If we are this second kind of person, we may need to take to heart the words of Jesus as we come to realize that by our negative attitudes, we destroy not only ourselves but also those around us.

So what will our response to God’s word be?  Is there something that I need to change in my life? Do I need to be less hasty in my judgements? Do I need to ask myself “Why is that person irritating me? What is it in me that reacts to someone’s else’s actions? Do I need to become less judgemental and more self-reflective?  

And so, as we gather this morning, we pray for the grace to take the inward journey, to take time to reflect on who we are, and how we interact with the world.

2022/03/06, 16:15 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 1st Sunday Lent – C - 2022

Leslie Dunkin once told a story about a dog he had when he was a young boy. This was an unusually obedient dog. Every now and again his father would test the dog’s obedience. He would place a tempting piece of meat on the floor. Then he would turn toward the dog and give the command, “No!” The dog, which must have had a strong urge to go for the meat, was placed in a most difficult situation to obey or disobey his master’s command. Dunkin said, “The dog never looked at the meat. He seemed to feel that if he did, the temptation to disobey would be too great. So he looked steadily at my father’s face.” There is a lesson there for all of us! When we are tempted, always keep our focus on the face of our Father. 

In today’s gospel (Luke 4:1-13), we hear the familiar story of how Satan tests Jesus in the desert. This comes as Jesus is about to begin his public ministry and serves as a showdown, so to speak, between good and evil. Satan tries to lead Jesus astray, but Jesus rejects Satan’s assault, affirming each time his loving obedience to his Father: “_You shall worship the Lord, your God, and him alone shall you serve._” The Gospel passage concludes with a cautionary note which suggests that, though defeated, Satan will return and try again. And indeed he does! The power of evil will return to attack Jesus at the moment of his Passion, but Jesus prevails and, because of God’s love, life will prove stronger than death.

How does Jesus resists all of these temptations? Is it because he is the son of God? Is it because he is super-human? I don’t thinks so.  Jesus was able to resist the temptations, because he had a very clear understanding of who he was. He keeps his focus on God the Father and in so doing has a very clear sense of his own self-worth and his purpose in life. He knew who he was – and believed in himself. Knowing that he was loved by God gave him the strength to resist whatever temptations were put before him. He has a sense of integrity in his life – a freedom that allows him to be who he is meant to be. That doesn’t mean that the temptations weren’t real - they were - what it does mean, however, is that Jesus was able to resist them because of a greater value - a sense of completeness that is reinforced because of his relationship with the father. 

There is a lesson here for us. When we find ourselves in a situation where we are tempted to take the wrong path, we need to turn our attention to God - keep our eyes on the face of Our Lord. 

In most cases our temptations exploit a frailty or a weakness in our life or our personality with a promise that we will be “better”, ‘stronger”, “happier” “more beautiful’ “more likable” “more popular” if we only have this one thing, or we do whatever it takes to fit in. Once we give in, it may seem for a moment that temptation’s promise came true, but we soon realise, that there is still something missing, and so we look to the next ‘thing’ or ‘promise’ to see if we can find the peace and contentment we week. Of course, nothing will bring completion to our lives, nothing will fill the emptiness within, only the love of God. As St Augustine’s reminds us “_You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in you_.” 

As we begin our Lenten journey, this season reminds us that we need to restore our relationship  with God. We do this, not so much by tackling the temptations we are grappling with, but by dealing with the vulnerabilities that are within us that the temptations exploit and promises to fix or overcome! 

All of us struggle / all of us are vulnerable / all of us need to hear God’s word reminds us that “you are my beloved son” / “you are my beloved daughter” – but more importantly we need to believe. To believe that we are okay / to believe that we have value – in spite of our darkness / to believe that we are loved / to believe that there is a place for us in God’s Kingdom. We need to trust ourselves and to trust God. 

So today, as we listen to God’s word, what do the readings ask of us? Maybe they ask us to seek the grace of self-acceptance / or an openness to listen and hear that we are beloved – that we are okay.

Let us pray for the grace, to not only hear with our ears, the promise that God makes, but more importantly, to believe with our heart, and to trust with our lives.

There is a story told about a man who wanted to test his wife’s hearing. He stood some distance behind her and said, “Love, can you hear me?” Having received no answer, he moved closer and again whispered, “Love, can you hear me?” Again, having received no answer he moved right up behind her and softly said, “Love can you hear me?” His wife replied, “Darling, for the third time, yes, I can hear you!” In some ways this story reflects the way that we communicate with God. We constantly check to see if God is listening in the hope that He will respond to our needs and petitions. The reality of course is that God hears us, but we don’t always listen for God’s response. We miss the ‘God moments’ in our life.

In our Gospel today (Luke 9:28-36) we hear the story of the transfiguration. Towards the end of the text, we are told that the three apostles hear a voice coming from the cloud, declaring “This is my chosen Son, listen to him.” 

So, what should we be listening for? It seems to me that the story of the transfiguration is first and foremost an assurance that God is always present in our lives and in our world. The transfiguration is a moment of insight for the apostles, who have journeyed with Jesus over the past number of years, but who have, up to that moment, not fully understood who Jesus was and what his purpose might be. 

Something similar happens in our lives. Often, our days can be so busy that we fail to recognise God’s presence, or we can be so bombarded with all that is wrong in the world, that we fail to see all that is good.  What if, like Jesus and the apostles, we took some time to step out of the busyness of our day, so that we could listen for God’s voice. 

If we took a few moments to sit and listen to our children as they play, what would we hear? We might hear some arguing and complaining, but we would also hear the joy of their laughter and their enthusiasm for living. You can be sure that God’s delight is in their joy. 

When we see a neighbour, a colleague, a spouse, or a family member caring for someone who is ill, aging or who has a debilitating disease, does their love, their faithfulness, their commitment and courage not give witness to the presence of God? 

What if we call to mind a close friend or loved one whom we have known for many years and remember the way that our soul fills with delight when we hear his or her voice, even if it is only in our memory? Is that not the presence of God’s grace? 

But the transfiguration is not only about seeing God’s presence in the present moment. It is also about strengthening the disciples, and ultimately us, for what is to come. In the preface of today’s Mass, we read “For after he had told his disciples of his coming death, on the Holy Mountain he manifested to them his glory, to show, even by the testimony of the law and the prophets, that the passion leads to the glory of the resurrection.”  The passion leads to the glory of the resurrection. In other words, that beyond the pain the suffering, the passion of our live, there is new life, there is resurrection. 

The moment of the transfiguration, and the other moments of grace where we experience God’s presence in a special way, are not for that moment alone, but are meant to sustain us in the times when we are faced with the trials of life. This is an acknowledgement that faith in Jesus won’t necessarily protect us from pain or suffering or grief, but that somehow, we can be assured that God is with us in those moments, and that beyond those trials, we will find new life. Just as Jesus rose to new life following the pain, rejection, humiliation, and his eventual death on the cross, so will we discover new life beyond our trials. 

So, this Lent, let us take time to draw closer to the Lord, so that we can recognise his voice in the ordinary things of life, and trust that, beyond our current trials, we will find peace again. 

Every time we notice another instance of God’s grace, our hearts are lifted up, our determination is strengthened, and our faith in God’s unfailing love is once again affirmed. 

Today, as we Listen to God’s word, what are the scriptures asking of us? To trust with Abraham that all will be well, and that God will not lead us to a place we shouldn’t be? To believe that God makes possible, what seems impossible in human terms. To listen more intently for the voice of God in our daily living? To believe that new life will come, in time?

As we continue our Lenten journey let us pray for the grace to see God’s hand at work in the ordinary events of our life and the courage to trust in God’s abiding presence.

2022/03/20, 12:48 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 3rd Sunday Lent - C - 2022  - Fr Jerry Browne

_The Mission_ was the title of a movie that was released in 1986 that told the story of a Spanish Jesuit priest who went into the South American jungle to minister to the local people who had been subjected to the cruelty of Portuguese colonials. 

One of the most powerful scenes in this film occurs when Captain Mendoza, who had killed his brother in a fit of rage, is seen climbing a mountain with a backpack on his shoulder as an act of penance for his past sins. The backpack, which contained all the weapons of his former life as a slave trader, represent a past life that still haunts him. It was so heavy that, at one point, it looked as if the backpack would drag him back down the mountain to his death. As Mendoza, clung to life, straining with all his strength to reach the top of the mountain, but looking like he was going to fall, a former slave comes forward and pulls out a knife. It looks as if the former slave is about to take his vengeance on Mendoza, but instead, he cuts the rope that tied Mendoza’s backpack to his back. The backpack and all its contents went tumbling down the mountain, and Mendoza climbed to safety. 

The scene makes two very powerful points about the importance of repentance. Firstly, it reminds us of the importance of acknowledging our sin and changing the way we live. And secondly, it reminds us that we cannot achieve our true potential as long as we drag our past with us. We cannot carry the burden of our failings, our sin and every mistake that we ever made with us for the rest of our days. There comes a time when we need someone to help free us from our burden, and give us a change to live again.

In our Gospel today, (Luke 13:1-9) Jesus offers us that second chance. He invites people to reflect on their lives and to make the changes that are necessary for them to fulfil their true purpose in life. Using two cautionary stories about how quickly our life can change – the stories of the Galileans whose blood was spilled at the hands of Pilate and the story of 18 people who lost their lives when a tower fell on them at Siloam - Jesus makes it clear that we need to change our life now, because our situation can change at any moment, and tomorrow might be too late. Today is the day.

While we see the urgency of Jesus’ call, we also witness the compassion of God in the parable of the Fig Tree. The Fig Tree, which represents our lives, isn’t bearing any fruit, so the owner of the garden tells the gardener “cut it down”. The Gardner asks him to leave the tree for one more year so that he can dig round it and manure it with the hope that it will bear fruit in the coming year - if not then it can be cut down. He gives the tree a second chance – so to speak. Interestingly, we never hear whether the fig tree bears fruit or not – the story – like our lives - is left open ended, with the implication that that there is no time to waste. 

Today is the day we need to begin digging  around our fig tree. It is the moment we are called to be our best selves. Not yesterday, because yesterday is gone and it can’t be changed, we can learn from us, but we can’t  re-live yesterday. And not tomorrow, for we do not know if tomorrow will come. So that leaves today.  Today is our day. 

Today is the day that we are meant to bear the fruits that we were created to bear. 

As we continue our Lenten Journey, what might the Lord be asking of us today? What do we need to change in our lives? Is there someone that we need to forgive? Do we need to ask forgiveness from someone that we have hurt? Do we bear the fruits of love, peace and forgiveness and contribute to making the world a better place, or do we add pain and heartache? 

Right now, we hear daily about the war in Ukraine. For us, Ukraine might seem very far away, and beyond our influence. But is it really? 

Mother Teresa was once asked by an inquiring reporter what people could do to bring about World Peace and improve the conditions of our world. Without hesitation she replied, “Go home and love your spouse and your children.” In other words, bloom where you are you are planted. You have your circle of influence. Use it to make the world a better place. World peace begins in our homes, not in the Ukraine. 

We have the opportunity to make a difference – and we don’t have to go the other side of the world to do it – we can do it here and now. We can make a difference in our families, in our school and in our workplace, when we produce the fruits of love, care, respect, forgiveness and acceptance.

So during this lent, let us pray for the openness and the courage to live in the moment and to be the people that God has called us to be.

2022/03/27, 13:34 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – 4th Sunday Lent C – Fr Jerry Browne 

There is a story told about a widow, who during the First World War, lost her only son and her husband. She was especially bitter because her neighbour, who had five sons, lost none of them.  One night, while this woman’s was still experiencing the raw pain of her grief, she had a dream. In her dream, an angel stood before her and said, “You might have your son back again for ten minutes. What ten minutes would you choose? Would you have him back as a little baby or as a young schoolboy, or as a student just completing high school, or as the young soldier who marched off so bravely to war?” The mother thought a few minutes and then, in her dream, told the angel she would choose none of those times. “Let me have him back,” she said, “when as a little boy, in a moment of anger, he doubled up his fists and shook them at me and said, ’I hate you! I hate you!” Continuing to address the angel, she said: “In a little while his anger subsided and he came back to me, his dirty little face stained with tears, and put his arms around me and said to me,  ‘Momma, I’m sorry I was so naughty. I promise never to be bad again and I love you with all my heart.’ Let me have him back for those few moments,” the mother sobbed. “I never loved him more than at that then, when he changed his attitude and came back to me.” 

Wouldn’t it be great if we all had moments of conversion like the little boy, recognising that we have done wrong, and then, with a changed attitude, take the risk to return to those whom we have hurt, trusting that we will be forgiven. 

Today’s gospel, (Luke 15:1-3, 11-32) suggests that the unconditional love and forgiveness of the mother, is also the way that we are welcomed by the Father, when we come home from our sinning ways.  At first sight, it looks like the young man who has gravely offended his father by asking for his inheritance - a huge insult to his father, akin to saying I can’t wait for you to die, so just give me the money and I will be out of here – it looks as if he understands the nature of unconditional forgiveness. But when we look again, we realise that, while he recognises the need for forgiveness, he doesn’t really forgive himself. Notice, when he prepares the few words that he will say to his father, he ends with the words, “treat me as one of your hired servants.” Implicit in those words is the understanding that he doesn’t deserve to be restored to his rightful place in the family, that he doesn’t deserve “full’ forgiveness, that he is willing to carry the shame of his sin, because he doesn’t deserve any better. That’s not how forgiveness works. 

As it turns out, when the young many arrives home, he is welcomed, literally, with open arms, so much so, that he seems somewhat overwhelmed - he only manages to get half way through the speech he has prepared, and then says no more. 

Why might that be? Could it be that the young man felt even worse about what he had done to his father, when he compared his actions to his father’s love and forgiveness? 

Is it possible that the parable might be addressing an issue that often lies just belove the surface, but is not given enough consideration – that is about self-forgiveness, that, despite the immediate and complete forgiveness of the father, the younger son was not able to forgive himself? 

Could it be that, although the father’s love announces a new beginning to their relationship, the younger son could only cling to the mistakes of the past, and that sometimes, just like the younger son, we find a way of resisting the love and forgiveness that God showers upon us. Has that ever happened to you? Have you found it difficult to forgive yourself?

It is clear that the love of the father in the parable is meant to represent God’s love for us, a love which is complete and unlimited. Our only choice is whether we are willing to accept that love and forgiveness or not. We might be aware that through our selfishness we have hurt someone we love, or  done things that have undermined our own self-worth. 

This parable insists that God’s forgiveness allows a new beginning. But will we live in a new way or will we continue to define ourselves by the mistakes of our past? When we are forgiven, it is necessary that we accept that reality and act forgiven.  

None of us makes it through life with a clean slate. This parable promises that God is willing to wipe our slate clean over and over again, and invites us to do the dame. This is God’s way of saying that, despite our flaws, we have a right to live, we have a right to be happy. The choice is ours.

And so today, as we listen to this word of God, how will we respond to God invitation? Are we willing to trust in God’s unconditional love and forgiveness? Are we willing to accept that forgiveness for ourselves? To forgive ourselves? Are we willing to believe that we are worthy of God’s love?

APRIL 3, 2022

Fifth Sunday of Lent

Finding Your Holy Places

Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.   John 8:1

This is the only place in the Gospels where the Mount of Olives is mentioned outside of the Passion narratives. Its inclusion here tells us something important about Jesus. First, Jesus went to the garden to pray. Prayer was a priority for him. What made this particular place so conducive to prayer? It was outside the gates of the city, beyond its busyness and din. It was a place of peace and solitude after a hectic day. Jesus must have felt close to God within this natural setting. Little wonder he sought out this same holy place the night before he died.

Where is your Mount of Olives, that is, your “holy place” where you feel close to God? Perhaps it is a certain church or chapel before the Blessed Sacrament. Or maybe it’s a park bench beside a lake, a pathway through the woods, a favorite jogging route or even the rocker on your back porch?

Jesus, help me to find holy places that will nourish my communion with you.

- His promise and His eternal covenant with you will never be broken.

- Expect the best, believe in His goodness and walk in His peace.

Constantine the Great was the first Christian Roman emperor. He was the son of Constantius, a pagan emperor who had a soft heart for Christians. It is said that when Constantius first took the throne as emperor, he discovered that many Christians held important jobs in the government and in the court.  For some reason, he decided to issue an executive order to all those Christians: “Either give up Christ or give up your jobs.” Much to Constantius’ delight, the great majority of Christians gave up their jobs rather than disown Christ. Only a few gave up their religion rather than lose their jobs. The emperor was impressed with the majority who showed the courage of their convictions and so gave their jobs back to them, while he dismissed those who were willing to give up their allegiance to Christ to keep their jobs, saying to them,  “If you will not be true to your God you will not be true to me either.”

Today we celebrate Passion / Palm Sunday. It is a commemoration of the day on which Jesus was put on trial and chose to be faithful to his mission, even thought it was about to cost him his life. The gospel story (Luke 22:14-23:56)  reveals that it was a testing time for many others too. 

It was a time of  testing for Judas – would he choose to betray Jesus? Would the lure of the money sway his judgement? Does it sway ours? 

It was a time of testing for Peter. Would he allow fear to choose the path for his life? Would he deny knowing the Lord? Do we? 

It was a time for testing for the chief priests and the Sanhedrin. Would they allow their prejudice and narrowmindedness to condemn an innocent man? Do we allow our prejudices to cloud our judgements, so that injustice prevails? 

It was a time of testing for the crowd. Would they allow themselves to be swayed by the mob in a moment of madness, and choose the criminal Barabbas over the innocent man Jesus? Do we allow our society or culture to shape our thinking to such an extent that we are afraid to offer a voice of dissent?  

It was a time of testing for others too! For Joseph of Arimathea, Simon of Cyrene, the women who follow Jesus. Each had choices to make. They could remain faithful to Jesus or walk away. 

In a way it is easy to observe the characters in the story and say what we might have done differently if we were in their situation. The real challenge of course is to look at our own lives today, to see what we do now. Do we remain faithful in our times of trial? Are we willing to risk the hostile stare because of our faith in Jesus? 

As we enter this most holy of weeks let us pray for the grace to be faithful members of Christ’s body. Let us declare our loyalty to Christ and our fidelity to His teachings as we carry our palms to our homes, and as we give witness to what he means in our life, where ever we might be – at the office, at work, at school, at home, at a party! 

Let us declare our choice to accept Jesus as the King and ruler of our lives and our families and ask for his grace to remain faithful to the mission that he has given to each of us at our baptism, particularly in our times of testing.

There is a story told about a rabbi who once asked his students: "How do we know when the night has ended and the day has begun?" The students thought for a moment and then one offered an answer. He said "Rabbi, it is when I look out at the fields and I can distinguish between my field and the field of my neighbour, that's when the night has ended and the day has begun." “No”, said the Rabbi. A second student offered his answer: "Rabbi, it is when I see an animal in the distance, and I can tell what kind of animal it is, whether a cow or a horse or a sheep, that's when the night has ended and the day has begun." “No”, said the Rabbi. Then a third student offered yet another answer: "Rabbi, it is when I see a flower and I can make out the colours of the flower, whether they are red or yellow or blue, that's when night has ended and day has begun. Again the Rabbi said “no, no, no”! Then the Rabbi said, “Do none of you understand? Can you not see what you are doing? You only divide! You divide your field from your neighbour’s field, you distinguish one kind of animal from another, you separate one colour from all the others. Is that all we can do? Divide? Separate? Split the world into pieces? Isn't the world broken enough? Isn't the world split into enough fragments? No, my dear students, this is not the way, not the way at all."

The shocked students looked at the Rabbi and said “Then tell us Rabbi, how do we know that night has ended and day has begun?" The rabbi looked at them, and then, with a gentle voice responded: "When you look into the face of the person who is beside you, and you can see that person is your brother or your sister, then finally the night has ended and the day has begun." 

As a Christian, a follower of Christ, has “day” begun for you? Can you look into the face of a stranger, or someone who is different from you, and see a brother or sister? Or are you still a work in progress? If you are, you are not alone. 

In our gospel today (John 20:1-9), we hear how, when the women went to the tomb, all those years ago, they had no expectation of new life, for them it was still night. John even mentions that it was still dark! This is a metaphor for the fact that they had not yet come to recognise who Jesus really was. They went with an old way of thinking, a way of thinking that limited their ability to see new possibilities, a way of thinking that went along with ‘how things have always been,’ a way of thinking that robbed them of hope and kept them in their darkness. Somehow, their many encounters with Jesus over the previous few years, though full of promise that life could be different, faded very quickly when he was put to death. It was if power and position and wealth, the status quo, would always win the day. 

It is only on Easter Sunday morning, when the women arrive at the tomb, and discover that Jesus is not there, that they begin to understand that something extraordinary has happened. At first they are confused, and think that someone has stolen the body of Jesus, but then, as they reflect on his life and his ministry, they begin to understand that his life and death has changed everything. 

At the beginning of his public ministry, Jesus declares "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has chosen me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set free the oppressed. 

Jesus gave flesh to these words in everything he did. He sat at table and ate with tax collectors and sinners. He healed the leper and welcomed the stranger. His messages of love and forgiveness were not only accompanied by acts of acceptance and inclusion, but were embodied at the Last supper and on the cross of Calvary, when he gave his very self so that a broken world might be healed and that humanity might be united again in the image of the one who created us. 

The moment of the resurrection is ‘proof’ that Jesus did not act alone, that he wasn’t just another great leader who preached a new way of life and wanted to do good, but that his life truly reflects the inner life of God. 

It is that life of unity and love that we are privileged to share in, through our baptism. It is a way of life that calls us to step out of the darkness and live as people of the light, to make a difference in the world. Each time we show love for others, we give witness to the inner life of God. Each time we experience a betrayal of trust and, with God’s grace, forgive the betrayer, we give witness to the inner life of God.  Each time we continue to hope - even when our hope seems futile - we give witness to the inner life of God.  

The message of Easter is that nothing can stand in the way of God’s plan for the world, not power, not sin, not rejection, not betrayal or even death, because Christ has conquered all these. And because Christ has conquered all these, we too can conquer them, through the power of the Holy Spirit, when we put our faith and trust in Him. 

So this Easter, let us open ourselves once again to the power of the risen Lord in our lives and recommit ourselves to living as people of the light.

May God bless you and keep you always in his saving Love.  Happy Easter.

Fear is a powerful emotion. At its best, it alerts us to danger and causes us to be cautious about how we proceed – and that’s a good thing. At its worst, however, fear can enslave us and limit our actions, so that we fail to live to our true potential. When that happens we end up not living the life that we are supposed to live, or doing the things that we want to do. We miss out on so much that life has to offer and end up not being true to who we are meant to be. 
In our gospel today (John 20: 19-31) we hear how Jesus comes and stands among his disciples, who were locked in a room because they were in fear of the Jews. Their fear had robbed them of their freedom, so much so, that they were unwilling to go about their ordinary lives. That is what fear does to all of us. Fear nags at our insecurities and weaves a web of apprehension and doubt, ever so delicate, yet powerful in its ability to hold us captive. 

When Jesus enters the room where the apostles were, following his greeting of peace, the first thing he does is show the disciples his wounded hands and side. While this gesture serves to affirm his identity, it also shows them, and us, that the cross, the source of their fear, an instrument of death that was meant to terrorise and end life, did not have the final say. It is as if Jesus is saying to them, “What’s the worst thing that can happen? Don’t let your fear keep you locked in this place.” 
And then Jesus does something that we have never seen him do up to this point in the gospels. He breathes on the disciples. To understand this gesture, we have to go back to the beginning, to the story of creation. 

There we read that “the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living being” (Genesis 2:7). This is a clear indication of God’s desire to share his divine life with humanity, who is made in His image and likeness.  When Adam and Eve turned away from God, sin entered the world, and the relationship between God and humanity is fractured. Despite this fractured relationship, however, the entire story of salvation speaks of God’s desire to restore and renew His life in us.  So when John includes the detail that Jesus breathed on the disciples on the day of his resurrection, he wants his listeners to understand that the relationship between God and humanity has been restored, through the breath of God.  From this moment on, liberated from their fear, Jesus sends the disciples out into the world, filled with the Holy Spirit, to continue the work he has begun in them. 

As the story unfolds, the evangelist draws our attention to Thomas, and his difficulty in believing the story that is told to him by the others who have witnessed the risen Lord. 
Thomas it seems was shattered when his leader and friend died on the cross, and wasn’t about to let himself hope again. Something like that happens in our life too when our hopes are crushed. We withdraw and start analysing the facts, looking to find out how things went wrong, or how we could have been mistaken. So when Thomas returns and hears stories of resurrection, he struggles to believe, and declares that he wants proof. “Unless I can see the holes that the nails made in his hands and can put my finger into the holes they made, and unless I can put my hand into his side, I refuse to believe.” 
Because Thomas wasn’t there when the risen Lord appeared, he becomes a forebear for all succeeding generations of Christians who are called to believe, not through their actual experience of the resurrection of Jesus, but through the testimony of others - the community of the Church. And when we struggle to believe, Jesus doesn’t dismiss us, or become angry with us, but just as he did with Thomas, he comes to meet us where we are. 

Is that not the whole point of the incarnation? That God becomes flesh, to meet us in our life experience, so that we can know in a personal way how much God loves us. God meets us where we are, loves us where we are, and then invites us to see new possibilities in our life. 

So today, as we gather here, let us open our lives to the gift of faith. Let us hear the Lord address us as he addressed Thomas when he said 
“Give me your hand.” Let us place our hand in the Lord’s, trusting that we are not alone, that the Lord has risen indeed. Let us let go of whatever it is that binds us in fear, trusting that the breath of God that gave life to creation, will through the Holy Spirit, give life to us too.

2022/05/01, 18:33 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 3rd Sunday Easter C 2022

I suppose there has been times in all of our lives when we have messed up, when we have hurt someone, betrayed someone, or disappointed someone that has a special place in our life. This was certainly the case with Jesus and his disciples. 
We are all familiar with the story of Peter’s betrayal of Jesus on the night that Jesus was arrested. There Peter was, warming himself next to a charcoal fire when a young woman asks him if he knows Jesus. Peter declares that he has nothing to do with Jesus, and denies knowing him, not just once, but three times - so much for the promises of loyalty that he had made a short time earlier. 

In today’s gospel, (John 21:1-19), we hear about another charcoal fire – actually this is the only other place that we hear about a charcoal fire in the gospel – apart from the courtyard. It seems that John wants us to make a connection between this charcoal fire, and the events of that fateful night, when Peter was questioned and denied knowing Jesus.

In today’s scene, on three different occasions, we hear Jesus ask Peter, “_Do you love me_”, and three times we hear Peter reply, “_yes Lord, you know I love you_.” There is something lost in the English translation of this exchange, because in the original Greek Jesus and Peter use two different Greek words for love, _Agape_ and _Philia_. The Greek word _agape_ describes the highest kind of love, an unconditional love that reflects the generous love of God and the Greek word _philia_ describes an ordinary human kind of love that we show one another. That is where we get the world Philadelphia – a word that means brotherly love. 

So, in the gospel scene, when Jesus questions Peter, he says something like “_Simon, son of John, do you love me with an unconditional love_?”, to which Peter responds, “_Lord, I love you with ordinary love_.” Perhaps Jesus senses Peter’s embarrassment at declaring his unconditional love having just denied even knowing him a short time earlier. So, Jesus tries a second time.  “_Simon, son of John, do you love me with an unconditional love_. Peter responds again, “_Lord, I love you with ordinary love_.”  By now it has become clear to Jesus that even though his is giving Peter a chance to redeem himself, that Peter isn’t yet able to accept that gift. Jesus doesn’t give up however, but this time he uses Peter’s word _philia_, for love. So, a third time Jesus asks, “_Simon, son of John, do you love me with an ordinary, philia, love_?” And Peter replies, “_Lord you know all things, you know that’s how I love you._” Then Jesus says, “_Feed my sheep_.” 

This interchange on the beach has a number of significant lessons for us. Firstly, the three questions that Jesus poses to Peter asking him if he is willing to declare his love for him (Jesus) are meant to ‘cancel out’ the three moments of betrayal in the courtyard. 

Secondly, the gift of forgiveness and love that God offers us when we mess up, is far greater than we can imagine, or think that we deserve. There are echoes here of the story of prodigal son, and how, after he returns home, he is unconditionally restored to his original place in the family.  

Thirdly, Jesus is willing to meet us where we are and is happy to accept whatever we are able to offer, even if it isn’t perfect. He accepts our human attempts at love, even with our imperfections, and is willing to work with the little we can offer, to bring about his plan for the world, while at the same time, inviting us to strive for the unconditional love that he offers each of us. 

As we reflect on this word of God, what might the Spirit be asking of us? Could it be an invitation to forgive those who have hurt us, understanding that human love is imperfect, that there will be times that we mess up, and so we, like the Lord, need to be generous in our compassion? Might it be that that there is someone that we should invite back into our lives again? Or might the Lord be saying to us, I love you unconditionally – can you accept this gift of agape, and share it with others?

2022/05/08, 12:09 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 4th Sunday Easter C 2022 – Fr Jerry Browne

I heard a very interesting story about a tourist who was travelling in the middle east. He came across three shepherds whose intermingled flocks were drinking water from a nearby stream. After an exchange of greetings, one of the shepherds turned toward the sheep and called out, "Manah. Manah." (Manah means "follow me" in Arabic.) Immediately his sheep separated themselves from the rest and followed him. Shortly afterwards, one of the two remaining shepherds called out, "Manah. Manah." and his sheep left the common flock to follow him. The traveller then said to the third shepherd, "I would like to try that. Would it be okay if I put on your cloak and turban and see if I can get the rest of the sheep to follow me."

The shepherd agreed. Then the traveller wrapped himself in the cloak, put the turban on his head and called out, "Manah. Manah," but the sheep didn’t respond to the stranger's voice. Not one of them moved toward him. Then the  traveller asked the shepherd "Will the sheep ever follow someone other than you?" "Oh yes," the shepherd replied, "sometimes when a sheep gets sick, it will follow anyone." 

How interesting is that, only a sick sheep will follow the voice of a stranger. I wonder if something similar happens in our lives when we lose our bearings, or when we fail to find them to begin with. Are there times when we are like sick sheep? When we fail to trust our intuition - the voice of the Holy Spirit within – how easily we can be distracted and allow ourselves to be manipulated by any number of voices that promise us all the things that we long for - belonging, popularity, happiness, power, wealth, or any of the other triggers that sound so appealing to someone who doesn’t know who they are, their purpose in life, or where they belong. Like sick sheep, we forget the voice of the one who offers us true life, and end up with a sense of hopelessness or despair as we search here, there and everywhere for the peace that eludes us.

Today, throughout the world, we celebrate world day of prayer for vocations. It is a day on which we are reminded that the Lord, the Good shepherd, has a purpose for each of us. We are invited to listen deeply for his voice, as we heard in today’s Gospel (John 10:27-30), because it is his call that will ultimately offer us the fulness of life that we seek. It is important to remember that the call of the Good Shepherd, or what we call a vocation, is not something that comes to a priest or a religious sister / brother only, but something that is offered to all the baptised. It is what God wants us to do with our life! Ultimately, it is a share in Christ’s mission in the world, which at its simplest, is about giving witness to the relational love of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in our day to day lives and relationships. 

If every one of us, who said yes to sharing in the mission of Christ at our baptism, were to listen deeply for the voice of the shepherd within, and act upon it, we would together change the face of the earth. 

Thomas Merton, one of the great catholic spiritual writers of the last century wrote “Discovering vocation does not mean scrambling toward some prize just beyond my reach but accepting the treasure of true self I already possess. Vocation does not come from a voice out there, calling me to be something I am not. It comes from a voice in here, calling me to be the person I was born to be, to fulfil the original selfhood given me at birth by God.” 

So what is the Lord asking of your life? Do you listen for his promptings within? For each of us the call will be to use the gifts and talents we have been gifted with to help bring about God’s plan for the world. For a small number it may be as a priest or religious brother or sister – and that call can come at any time in one’s life - but there are hundreds of other ways of sharing in the mission of Christ, so that God’s will for the world might be accomplished. 

I want finish with a prayer attributed to the late Archbishop Oscar Romero who was murdered while saying Mass in El Salvador in 1980. It is a reminder that we don’t have to save the world on our own, but that each of us has something to offer, that becomes part of a greater picture. He writes: “This is what we are about, we plant seeds that one day will grow. We water seeds already planted, knowing that they hold future promise. We lay foundations that will need further development. We provide yeast that produces effects beyond our capabilities. We cannot do everything and there is a sense of liberation in realising that. This enables us to do something, and to do it very well. It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning, a step along the way, an opportunity for God’s grace to enter and do the rest. We may never see the end results, but that is the difference between the master builder and the worker. We are workers, not master builders, ministers, not messiahs. We are prophets of a future not our own.”

As we gather here this morning, we take a moment again to reflect on our own story,  and what the spirit may be saying to us. How do I share in the Mission of Christ in the world? How do I give witness to God’s love in my life, and what might I need to do differently, so that I can respond to the Lord’s call deep within.

I’m sure that most people in the world who would agree with the principle that love is an ideal that we should all strive to achieve. Why would anyone be against love? Most would agree that we are at our best when we manage to love our family, our friends, and the people that we meet in our day to day life. For many, love is a warm, sometimes romantic feeling, of closeness that enables us to feel good about ourselves and others. However, when we see love only as a feeling, something that can come and go depending on our mood, we lose something of the potential of this powerful emotion. The reality of course is that love is far more robust that a sentimental feeling, and has the power to change the course of our lives. 

There are two phrases in today’s gospel (John 13: 31-35) that help us unpack this reality. The first is Jesus’ comment, “By this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” It seems clear that Jesus is saying that love is going to be the defining mark of the commitment that we have made to share in the values and the way of life that he has modelled for us. It is not something that we can just talk about, but something that we need to practice in our daily lives? Jesus’ words reveal that he has a specific kind of love in mind, a love which, somehow, goes beyond the superficial level of love that seems to define relationships in today’s society and asks that we see the other person for who they truly are, made in God’s image, and not simply the sum of their weaknesses, faults and failings. 

That kind of love requires a decision, a choice that we have to make, to love the other in spite of their faults and failings. 

This is where the second important phrase in today’s gospel has significance. The gospel highlights the fact that Jesus gave this new commandment “when Judas had left them.” In other words, the commandment to love is given in the context of betrayal. How amazing is that? Even though Jesus knows that Judas is about to hand him over to the Jewish authorities, Jesus commands his disciples to love one another. His command doesn’t exclude anyone  - even the one who has just left and is about to betray him!

For Jesus, the mark of discipleship is not that we call ourselves Christians, or followers of the way, or that we make the sign of the cross, or even that we break bread together. The mark of discipleship is that we follow his example in our daily living. The gospel makes that clear “Love one another. As I have loved you, so you also should love one another.” Jesus isn’t talking about some kind of sentimental love that we might read about on a greeting card. Instead he is talking about the kind of love that imitates his love, a love that went to the cross; a love that was willing to overlook the shortcomings of those who had hurt him. We see him give witness to this on the cross when he said: “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” 
That kind of love  understands that there are times when people will hurt us, not necessarily intentionally, perhaps some do, but it understands that when someone hurts us, it is always because they are carrying a hurt inside of themselves that they have failed to resolve. Healthy people don’t intentionally hurt someone that they are in relationship with. Most often, hurt is born of hurt.  

Thomas Merton, the great spiritual writer of the last century, spoke about this when he wrote: “As  long as we are on earth, the love that unites us will bring us suffering by our very contact with one another, because this love is the resetting of a Body of broken bones.  Even saints cannot live with saints on this earth without some anguish, without some pain at the differences that come between them. There are two things which [people] can do about the pain of disunion with others. They can love or they can hate.”

One of those responses frees us to be who we are meant to be, the other festers like an infected wound within, and ultimately causes us to become ill. That is why Jesus gave us the great commandment, not a recommendation, not a suggestion, but a commandment, to love one another, because he knew that love is the only way to save ourselves, and ultimately heal the world. 

This command to love one another, is a disturbing, countercultural command that asks us to show mercy to those who are guilty, to show respect to those who have hurt us, to refuse to do violence to those who have done violence to us. It asks that we begin by loving ourselves, in other words, healing ourselves, and coming to terms with some of the hurt that we have brought with us from our past, because it is only then that we can begin to cope with another’s pain, and accept them for the frail beings that they are. 

So today, as we gather here, what might this gospel be asking of you? What might the Holy Spirit be saying to your life at this time? Is there something within yourself that you need to heal? Is there a relationship that you need to help restore? Are we being invited to look beyond the frailties of the other, and see the person for who they really are, very possibly someone in pain that needs to be loved?

2022/06/05, 13:12 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily Pentecost – 2022 - Fr Jerry Browne

Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit order, often ended his letters to confreres who were going to the missions with the words ‘go set the world on fire.” Saint Catherine of Sienna used similar imagery when she declared “Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire.” In our first reading today (Acts 2:1-11) we hear how, on the day of Pentecost, the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit. This event happened after what appeared to be “tongues of fire” came to rest on each of them. This outpouring of the Holy Spirit is the moment when the church was empowered to carry on the Mission of Christ in the world, something that each of us shares in by virtue of our baptism. 

Pope Francis, in his message for World Mission Sunday this year reminds us of this when he writes “Christ was the first to be sent, as a “missionary” of the Father (cf. Jn 20:21), and as such, he is the Father’s “faithful witness” (cf. Rev 1:5). In a similar way, every Christian is called to be a missionary and witness to Christ.  And the Church, the community of Christ’s disciples, has no other mission than that of bringing the Gospel to the entire world by bearing witness to Christ. To evangelize is the very identity of the Church.

So when Ignatius of Loyola says “Go set the world on fire” and St Catherine says “Be who God meant you to be and you will set the world on fire,” they are really saying “go and share with the world the mission that you received from Christ, the mission that comes from the heart of God, the mission that you became part of the moment you were baptised. Go and help the world to find a different way - a way that reflects the inner life of God, a way that speaks of unity, a way that speaks of love, a way that recognises the dignity of every person you meet, a way that liberates people from their fears and burdens, a way that frees people to be who they are meant to be. 

Central to this mission that comes from the heart of God is love. This is echoed in today’s Gospel (John 14: 15-16; 23-26) when Jesus declares “Whoever loves me will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our dwelling with him.” It is love that transforms, it is love that heals, it is love that unites, it is love that frees us to be the best version of ourselves.  

As part of today’s Mass we get to listen to an ancient poem or sequence that speaks eloquently of the work of the Holy Spirit. It takes the form of a prayer that the Spirit’s work will be felt in our church and world today. The following is a short excerpt of the poem: 
“Come, Holy Spirit, come…! / Shed a ray of light divine! / Come, Father of the poor! / Come, within our bosoms shine. / Heal our wounds, our strength renew; / On our dryness pour your dew; / Wash the stains of guilt away; / Bend the stubborn heart and will; / Melt the frozen, warm the chill; / Guide the steps that go away. / On the faithful, who adore / And confess you, evermore / Give them virtue’s sure reward, / Give them your salvation, Lord; / Give them joys that never end. Amen.”

As Christians we have received the same Holy Spirit that fell on the apostles at Pentecost. Jesus comes and stands in our midst and sends us forth. “As the father sent me, so I send you.” He sends us into the world armed with the knowledge and assurance of His Love, empowered with the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and asks us to make a difference. 
Pentecost is about empowerment and about new possibility. It is the undeniable certainty that the world can be a better place. It is the assurance that out of death comes new life. It is a reminder that we have a part to play in bringing God’s plan to fruition. The Spirit continues to abide with us, to support us, to lift us up, to encourage us and to send us into the world as witnesses – witnesses to God’s goodness, God’s love and God’s mercy. 

So today as we celebrate Pentecost, let us take courage as we open ourselves to the gift of the Holy Spirit, so that God’s plan for the world might become a reality.

2022/06/12, 18:05 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily – Trinity Sunday - Cycle C, 2022 - Fr Jerry Browne

There is a beautiful Russian icon of the Blessed Trinity which was painted in the 15th century by a Russian monk named Rublev. The icon is regarded as one of the greatest pieces of religious art ever created and depicts a wordless conversation between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. It is based on an earlier icon known as the “Hospitality of Abraham” which depicts the three angels who visited Abraham at the Oak of Mamre (Genesis 18:1-15) sitting around a table. The thing that is immediately striking about the Trinity Icon is the fact that there is a vacant place at the front of the table. The vacant place is meant to convey openness, hospitality and welcome towards the stranger and outsider.

For Rublev the symbolism is clear. At the heart of God we find a community of love, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, who not only know, love and respect one another, but whose love and welcome both flows outwards revealing the _misso dei_, the mission of God, which is about God sharing God’s self with the world – but also opens itself up and welcomes others in, so that they may experience the intimacy of a deep and personal relationship with God. 

How different our world, our society, our families, our marriages and our relationships might be if we took time to dig deeper and find our true selves as relational beings, rather than living on the surface where we measure our worth and the worth of others on outward appearances. 

Real love, trinitarian love, is self-giving and only looks for the benefit of the other. Time and again we see this love manifest in the life of Jesus. It is evident in his care and compassion for others, in his respect for the person rather than their role in society, in his desire for healing and reconciliation, in his ability to welcome the stranger and to include those on the margins. He showed us that real love has no bounds. 

The way of Jesus is an invitation to a way of living, loving, and relating that reflects a community of equals. It is found in the very ordinary ways that we offer each other love, care and forgiveness. It is also to be found when we raise our voices in condemnation in the face of injustice and inequality and when we stand in solidarity with the poor and the oppressed. There is no freedom when all are not free. There is no equality when all are not considered equal. 

So today, as we celebrate Trinity Sunday, what difference will our faith in the triune God make in our lives? Will we strive to live as people who recognise the importance of mutual respect and love? Will we seek a deeper truth about our existence, rather than being swayed by the marketing companies who sell the lie that ‘appearance’ will bring happiness? Will we work to build relationships, in the sure knowledge that it is only then that we can begin to heal our world and ourselves. 

We are not alone in this great quest, because Jesus has given us the gift of the Holy Spirit, (John 16:12-15) the one who is our strength. It is the spirit that guides us and gives us the  courage and wisdom we need to make the best decisions in life. Let us pray for the grace of openness and a willingness to trust the one in whose image we are made, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

Fr Brennan Manning is a Franciscan priest who tells the following story about his mother and her neighbour. Mrs Manning was a lady in her mid-seventies. Her day centred on going to Mass and receiving the Eucharist. Because she volunteered at a local drug rehabilitation centre every morning at 7.30am, the only Mass she could attend was at 5:30am. Across the road from her lived a very successful lawyer in his mid-thirties. He was married with two children. The man wasn’t a church goer, and was particularly critical of people who went to church every day. Driving home from a late party at 5.00am one January morning, the roads glassy with ice, he said to his wife, referring to Mrs. Manning, “I bet you that the old lady won’t be out this morning”. But to his shock, as he rounded the corner into their street, there she was on hands and knees negotiating the hill up to the Church. 

He went home, got into bed and tried to sleep, but couldn’t. A few hours later he got out of bed and went to the local parish office and asked to see a priest. “Padre,” he said, “I am not one of yours. In fact, I have no religion. But could you tell me what do you have in this church that can make an old woman crawl up here on her hands and knees on an icy morning?” That was the day that Mrs Manning’s neighbour began his conversion to faith in Jesus, along with his wife and family. 

Mrs. Manning had never studied theology or probably wouldn’t have been able to explain how a piece of bread became the body of Christ, but she knew what it was to meet Jesus in the Eucharist. Jesus Christ is the bread of life, and she knew it.

Today, as we reflect on the feast of Corpus Christi, the Body and Blood of Christ, we are reminded that what we do here is meant to shape the rest of our lives, just as it shaped the life of Mrs Manning. When we say yes to Christ in the Eucharist, we are saying yes to living lives that put Christ at the centre. The early Christians knew this. Their lives looked substantially different to the people around them – they stood out from the crowd, because of the way they lived. In fact their lives attracted so much attention, that many wild rumours abounded about what the Christians actually taught and did at their meetings. To clear the air, a church leader by the name of Tertullian wrote a short explanation of Christian practices. He wrote “It is mainly the deeds of a love so noble that lead many to put a brand upon us. See how they love one another, they say, for they themselves are animated by mutual hatred; how they are ready even to die for one another, they say, for they themselves will sooner put to death (The Apology Ch. 39).”

The Christian way is animated by love. It is recognised in the way that people give and receive rather than the way people take and hoard. This contrast can be seen in the difference between the first Adam, as in Adam and Eve, and the second Adam, Jesus. 

In the book of Genesis we hear how Adam took the forbidden fruit, which ultimately led to the fall of humanity, with sin entering the world. Contrast this with the life of Jesus, who gave his life for all and restored love as the measure of what it is to be human. 

This action is echoed in today’s gospel, when we hear the story of the feeding of the 5000. (Luke 9:11-17). In that story, the Lord knew that the people who had gathered to listen to him were hungry. His response was to give. He took the bread and fish, blessed them, broke them and gave them to the crowd, actions that foreshadow the events of the Last Supper and the institution of the Eucharist where Jesus took the bread and wine, blessed them, broke them, gave them, all actions that we witness  every time we celebrate the eucharist. Luke wants us to make the connection between what we do every time we participate in the eucharist, and the lived reality that they signify. 

Every time we come to share in the Eucharist we are making the choice to share in the life of Christ, the 2nd Adam, a life that invites us to give and receive with love, rather than the life of the first Adam, which is about taking and self-importance, characteristics that ultimately bring destruction. 

Sometimes, when we are faced with the challenges of being Christ in the world, we can feel somewhat overwhelmed – the hunger is so great and our resources so few. And so maybe we are inclined to be more like the first Adam, thinking of ourselves first. What can we do differently? At times like that it is important to remember that we are not expected to fix the world, but we are asked to continue to look outward, rather than focus on our need alone. When we reflect on today’s gospel story we see how Jesus took the little offering of 5 loves and two fish - and somehow in his hands, it was enough. 

Every time we share in the Eucharist, we are invited to take the little we have, and join our lives with Christ, and he will do the rest. Mrs Manning knew this, and so made sure to centre her day on the eucharist. We can do the same. 

I want to finish with a prayer of thanksgiving by Padre Pio which somehow recognises how much of a challenge it is to  put out trust daily in the Lord. It goes:

“Stay with me, Lord, for it is necessary to have You present so that I do not forget You.  You know how easily I abandon You.

Stay with me, Lord, because I am weak and I need Your strength, that I may not fall so often.

Stay with me, Lord, for You are my life, and without You, I am without fervour.

Stay with me, Lord, for You are my light, and without You, I am in darkness. 

Stay with me, Lord, to show me Your will.

Stay with me, Lord, so that I hear Your voice and follow You.

Stay with me, Lord, for I desire to love You very much, and always be in Your company.

Stay with me, Lord, if You wish me to be faithful to You.

Stay with me, Lord, for as poor as my soul is, I want it to be a place of consolation for You, a nest of love.

Stay with me, Jesus, for it is getting late and the day is coming to a close, and life passes; death, judgment, eternity approach.  I need your presence and your love to renew my strength.”

Stay with me Lord…

2022/06/26, 11:51 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 13th Sunday C 2022 – Fr Jerry Browne 

George Whitfield was an English evangelist who lived in the 18th Century. He regularly conducted outdoor evangelisation campaigns during a period of revival called the “Great Awakening.” Thousands of people responded to his Gospel message. After one of his sermons, someone asked Whitfield how many people were converted. Whitfield replied: “We’ll know in five years.” In other words, its all very easy to say “Yes, Yes, Lord” but it’s the lived reality of our lives that will determine if we are genuine in our commitment. 

At our baptism all of us made a decision to follow Christ, a decision that we recommit to each time we profess our faith. It is a decision that has the power to change our lives and the world that we live in, if we are ready to embrace the values, vision and the way of life that Jesus lived.

Both the first reading (1 Kings 19:16) and the Gospel (Luke 9:51-52), today highlight the far-reaching implications of responding to God’s call in our life. It is a call that asks for significant change in how we live and how we see the world. 

In the reading from the book of Kings, the prophet Elijah is instructed by the Lord to anoint Elisha to be his successor. Having received the call, Elisha slaughters his Oxen and chops up the plough to use it as fuel to cook the meat. This dramatic gesture is meant to signifies that, for Elisha, there is no turning back. He knows that once he responds to this call of the Lord, his life will never be the same again. There is no going back. 

Part of the call involves being prepared to leave our old ways behind in order to live a new life, a life that is shaped by our faith in Christ and the kingdom values that he preached.  We see this in today’s gospel when Jesus tells the young man to leave everything behind and “go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” It is a fairly radical request, but one that signifies the importance of the decision that discipleship involves. 

By proclaiming the Kingdom of God, Jesus is announcing that God’s plan, God’s desire for the world is fundamentally different to the life now being lived by many. God’s plan, God’s desire, honours each individual for who they are, and measures their value and worth, not by the labels of culture and society, but by the fact that they are made in God’s own image.

As we show respect and love for one another, and work towards harmony and unity, rather than prolonging the social distinctions that deny the value and worth of each other, we change the world we live in and help bring about God’s reign, God’s kingdom, God’s plan for the world. 

Take today’s gospel for example. The story relates how Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. He and his disciples could either go through Samaria or take a longer, more difficult route east of the Jordan River. Jesus chose the shortcut through Samaria. 
The fact that Jesus was heading to Jerusalem was a sign to the Samaritans that he was Jewish. This brings our all the historical and cultural prejudices and biases that have shaped the relationship between the Jews and the Samaritans for generations - not just from the Samaritans who refused to honour Jesus as a prophet, but also from the disciples James and John who wanted to call down fire from Heaven to consume the lot. 

Jesus uses this moment to teach the disciples about letting go, letting go of cultural bias, letting go of old hurts, letting go of labels, letting go of whatever might prevent us  from choosing God’s way – sometimes that even means letting go of family – or at the very least the bias of our family’s way of doing things. 

Following this incident with James and John, we hear about 3 encounters Jesus has with people who want to be disciples,  followers of his way. Jesus makes it clear that  following the way of the kingdom, following God’s way, is not going to be easy. 
The disciple has to decide  which  has priority – loyalty to family, to culture, to the old ways, or loyalty to the Mission that Jesus is about – bringing about the Reign of God!

At first glance the message might seem very harsh – but we have to remember that Luke’s objective is to present the far-reaching requirements of discipleship. He doesn’t want any confusion, if we make the choice to follow Jesus, we have to follow him all the way! 

Every day we are faced with situations where we have to make choices to be faithful followers of Christ – in our homes - which is often one of the most difficult places to do it – at our workplace,  in our schools. As we make those choices, we have to ask  ourselves the question “Is this what a follower of Christ would do?” Sometimes the choices won’t be easy and will require great sacrifices from us, looking for the good in the other, letting go of our biases, choosing to do the best and not only the good, loving when love is hard and difficult,  but when we do these things, ultimately our lives will be the richer for it, and we will help to make the world we live in a better place. 

So today, we pray for the grace to be faithful to our promises, the promises that we made at our baptism, and the promises that we repeat each time we profess our faith, promises that invites us  to  strive to bring about God’s kingdom in the here and now. Let us pray for the grace and courage that we need to be faithful to our commitment to the Lord.

Do you ever hear yourself talking about people who are different from you and using words life “they” or ‘those people” or in a conflict situation reverting to a phrase like “you people”? This kind of language is basically an “us” verses “them” way of thinking and essentially involves looking at others and saying "they are not like me", “they are not as good as us”, or "they are not one of us."

One of the main ways that any group maintains its identity is by asserting its difference from other people. It shows itself in things like badges and flags, attitudes and beliefs, collected stories and traditions. 

Whatever the nature of the group, whether it is a tribe, a school, a political party, a religious group, or a different race or culture group, loyalties within the group can be a good things, and can foster the growth of the members, and create a sense of pride and passion. All of that is fine as long as it is kept in check. 

The danger of course is when loyalty to the group, and the emphasis on difference, becomes so intense that it begins to focus on the negative aspects of those who are different from us, so much so that it creates a belief in one group that their differences make them better than other people. 

In today’s gospel (Luke 10:25-37) we see Luke explore the question of dealing with people who are different from us, and remind us that love is stronger than difference, that love takes precedence over difference. 

A scholar of the law asks Jesus what he must do to inherit eternal life. Jesus turns the question around and asks what the law says. The scholar knows the answer. We all know the answer. Love God and love your neighbour. 

The Book of Deuteronomy, (Dt 30:10-14) reminds us that God not only gives us His Commandments in Holy Scriptures, but that they are also written in our hearts, in the depts of our very being. We all know what is right and wrong – something tugs at us when we pass a person in need – that is God’s word, God’s desire, God’s love looking for attention – looking for a way to be made real in our lives. 

When Jesus affirms the scholars answer, the scholar wants to explore the question of who is my neighbour, and how far one is expected to go. 

You see, according to the law the word “neighbour” had essentially meant people who belonged to the people of the covenant – the chose people. There was certainly a need to treat the foreigner with justice and hospitality, but the word neighbour had closer, almost familial bonds - and was taken to mean ‘people who are part of our group’.

So the scholar asks the question, the answer to which, has made for some uncomfortable scripture ever sense. Who is my neighbour?
Jesus aware of the intent behind the scholar’s question, wants to challenge the questioners narrow interpretation of the Jewish law, and so tells the story of the Good Samaritan. 

Now the history behind this story is important. It has to do with why the Jews despised the Samaritans. When they were in exile, some Jews married the gentiles among whom they lived. In time they began to take on some of their  practices, which were seen as unclean by the Jews who kept to a more strict observance of the law. Those who were faithful to the law saw the behaviour of those who intermarried with the gentiles and began to take on their practices, as a betrayal of the Jewish heritage and of God. 

These Jews, who became known as Samaritans, were shunned by the Jews, and were essentially despised as traitors. This sense of betrayal ran deep, and led to deep resentment between the Jews and the Samaritans. 

In telling the story of the Good Samaritan, Jesus wants the young scholar, to step over the strict reading of the law, and to first ask the question, ‘what does it mean to be human’.  
The story helps to move the conversation out of the head, where a strict interpretation of the law can be used to dismiss the other as unworthy, as undeserving, as ‘less than’, to the heart, where the commandment of God reminds us that we are all human. In doing so, Jesus helps the scholar, and us, to understand that our neighbour is the one who shares our humanity, who in a moment of need calls out to our basic human instincts. 
We become neighbours by virtue of our attentiveness to the needs of others.  How different our world would be if we took more time to move out of our head space, to move beyond the labels that define our society, and give us excuses to ignore the plight of a brother or sister. 

What a different world it would be, if we treated one another with compassion and kindness, if we looked at people, the people around us, and saw a brother or sister, a fellow human being, rather than a label that highlights our differences. 

Jesus paid little attention to the fact that the man who helped the man on the side of the road was a Samaritan, instead his focus was on the actions and compassion of the helper, who happened to be a Samaritan. Even the young Jewish scholar has to admit that the actions of the one who helped, the Samaritan, are more neighbourly, than the Jewish priest and Levite who passed by on the other side. 

The gospel offers a great challenge to us in our current context. We live in a society that legitimised the superiority of one group over another. These historical realities run deep. The challenge of the gospel is to interrogate those assumptions and to find them wanting. Each one of us can contribute to the healing of our society, and to bringing about a more compassionate way of living, as we take time to reach out to a brother or sister in need. 

And so, this morning as we gather here, what might these scriptures be saying to us? What are the excuses that I use, what are the labels that I use? What are the reasons I give myself for not helping, and are they good enough if we are truly going to call ourselves Christian?

2022/07/17, 12:31 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 16th Sunday C 2022 - Fr Jerry Browne

There is a story told about a mother, who while listening to the prayers of her small daughter, heard her listing some requests for blessings that children often do. “Bless Mommy and Daddy and Grandma and Grandpa …” and so on. The mom was surprised, however, when she heard her child conclude her prayer with these words: "Now, Jesus, what would you like me to do for you?" That’s a great prayer! “Now Jesus, what would you like me to do for you?” 

Somehow it captures a key aspect of what prayer is about, being present to God, listening to God, so that we might be present to one another. 

The story of salvation reveals a God, in whose image we are made, reaching into our world and our lives and saying to us “I want to be present to you and I want you to be present to me, to know me, to experience me in your life, to know that you are loved by me.” In Jesus we see this intimacy revealed in his day-to-day ministry when he reaches beyond the societal and cultural conventions of the day and physically touches the outcast and welcomes the stranger. It is seen in his teaching stories such as the Good Samaritan, which we heard last Sunday, where the hero of the story turns out to be someone who would normally be shunned by ‘pious, upstanding, religious people’ and yet becomes the model for how we should treat one another.  

In today’s gospel (Luke 10:38-42) we meet two women, Martha and Mary, who have just welcomed Jesus into their home. This story follows on directly from last Sunday’s gospel and continues to challenge some of the social and cultural conventions of the day. For example, it was not the practice that a woman would welcome a man into her house! And of course for Mary to sit at Jesus' feet, and for him to allow her to do so, was controversial in itself, because by doing so, Mary, a woman, was taking "the place and posture of a disciple” which was contrary to normal practice in first-century Judaism.

Quite often when we read this passage we rush to defend, and sympathise with, Martha, when Jesus declares that Mary ‘has chosen the better part.’ It is important to remember, however, that this is a teaching story where the message of the previous story, the parable of the Good Samaritan, is opened up and explored. That story explored the great commandment “You shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart, with all your being, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself." Both stories are controversial, and have far-reaching social and cultural implications if taken to heart. 

In today’s story Luke explores a crucial aspect of what is necessary in order for us to fulfil the great commandment – and that has to do with the importance of being ‘present’ - being present to God, to ourselves and to one another. It is when we take time to be present to God, that we come to understand more fully the need to be present to ourselves and to one another. Just like the little girl in our opening story - when we draw close to God - we come to a place where we can say “Now Jesus, what would you like me to do for you?”  It is in those silent moments, as we come to understand the true meaning of love - love that begins in God – love that helps us to understand our own value and worth, that we come to understand how we are meant to be with each other. 

The challenge for us is to be able to manage our busy lives so that we are still able to take time to listen and be present to God. To discover that in the long workweek, or the charity that we support, or the chores that we do around the house, or the long traffic jams, or the dog that need walking, or the six hours of load shedding, that there is something sacred. God is present in all of those moments – and we often miss that. 

Above all, it is about recognising that as much as we find God in the mundane aspects of our life, we find God also within ourselves, and in the people that we encounter every day, and that has profound implications for how we live. 

The story of Martha and Mary bring together two women sharing the same house, living under one roof. In a way the two of them become a model for our lives, embodying both the contemplative and the desire to serve. They remind us that we must first sit at the feet of the Lord, so that we can know more fully where the Lord wants us to put our efforts, and then that there are times when we need to roll up our sleeves and do the work of the Lord. 

The Lord needs us at times to be the good Samaritan to others, to share in his compassionate work of serving others in practical ways. He needs us to visit the sick, to support the weak, to help carry the burdens of others. There are other times when he needs us, and wants us, to be still before him and to ponder his word. This is the two-fold rhythm that is at the heart of following him, listening prayerfully to the word of God and then keeping it by the way we live. 

And so this morning, as we gather here, what is it that these scriptures might be saying to us? That we need to slow down a little? That we need to take more time in silence? That we need to draw closer to the Lord, so that we can know more fully God’s desire for our lives?

2022/07/24, 12:08 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 17th Sunday C 2022 - Fr Jerry Browne

I love a good bargain. I’m in my element when I’m in a market somewhere and I can wrangle over the price of a particular item, and I won’t give in easily. In today’s first reading, (Genesis 18:20-32) we meet Abraham, whom it seems has a similar fondness for negotiating. In this case he is busy bargaining with God over the number of just people needed to save the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah from destruction. It is kind of comic to see Abraham bargaining with God for the best deal, particularly when he eventually saves the town not for 50, 45, 40, 30, or 20 just people, but for the bargain price of 10 just people. 

Perhaps, for many of us, our approach to prayer is similar to Abraham’s conversation with God. It is about arguing and cajoling and pleading with God to see if we can get what we want. Sometimes we make promises to do this, that, or the other things, if only God will relent, and grant this one request. 

The problem with this approach however, comes when our prayers are not answered, at least not how we would like them to be. At times like that, we often end up second guessing ourselves, and God. We begin to imagine that we have done something wrong; or that we haven’t prayed hard enough; or that God isn’t listening to us; or that God is angry with us, or that there is something wrong with us; or maybe that we are not good enough! In situations like that, our prayer can cause more heartache and guilt, than comfort and consolation, so we end up wondering whether it is worth praying or not, or worse still, pulling away from God altogether, because we think that God doesn’t love us. 

Our gospel today (Luke 11:1-13) offers another model of prayer. It is significant that it begins by recording that "Jesus was praying in a certain place and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, ‘Lord, teach us to pray.'" It seems obvious that the disciples had witnessed Jesus at prayer time and again, and that they began to realise how vital and influential it was for his life and his ministry. The more they journeyed with him, and the closer they drew to him, they came to realise that the source of his spiritual power had something to do with his prayer life. 

In teaching the disciples how to pray, Jesus helps the disciples, and us, to see that the primary focus of our prayer should be on God rather than on ourselves. To pray is to reach out of ourselves towards God. We express our longing for God’s name to be honoured, for God’s kingdom to come on earth, for God’s will to be done. It is about drawing closer to God, so that we can understand more fully God’s desire for our lives, much like the relationship of a parent and a child.  

As such, prayer is about relationship. It is an acknowledgement of our total dependence on God and our willingness to trust that we are part of God’s great plan, even when we don’t always understand how the plan is unfolding. 

Within this primary focus, Jesus teaches that there is also a place where we can pray for ourselves, where we express our dependence on God. First our physical dependence “give us this day our daily bread”; then our emotional dependence “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us”; and finally our spiritual dependence “Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.“ 

This approach to prayer contrasts vastly with how many of us usually pray. Often our prayer is about what God can do for us, rather than our desire to be in relationship with God. 

It’s a bit like the story of the mother who overheard her fifth grade son at prayer just before he got into bed. As he knelt beside his bed in prayer, she overheard him praying over and over again. "Let it be Tokyo! Let it be Tokyo! Please dear God, let it be Tokyo!" When he finished praying, the mom asked, "What did you mean, ‘Let it be Tokyo'?" "Oh," the boy said with embarrassment, "we had our geography exam today and I was praying that God would make Tokyo the capital of France."

Prayer is not going to change the capital of France. It is not a magical means by which we get God to do what we want. Rather prayer at its best is an inner openness to God which allows his divine power to be released in us. Ultimately, the power of prayer is not that we succeed in changing God, but that we come to a deeper understanding of how God is present in out life. 

This understanding of prayer is beautifully illustrated in the movie ‘Shadowlands’ which tells the story of how CS Lewis is coping with the fact that his wife Joy has been diagnosed with cancer. In one scene, Lewis, who is lecturing at the university of Oxford, is just leaving the college chapel, where he has spent some time in prayer, when he runs into a colleague by the name of Professor Harrington. Harrington ask how Joy is doing, to which Lewis replies that she is doing okay. Harrington then says “I know how hard you have been praying, and now God is answering your prayer”. Lewis replies “That's not why I pray, Harry. I pray because I can't help myself. I pray because I'm helpless. I pray because the need flows out of me, waking and sleeping. It doesn't change God, it changes me.” 

So somehow, prayer is our response to a deep, perhaps unconscious, realisation, that we are totally dependent on God. Perhaps this is why Jesus urges his followers to be persistent in prayer, not so much in listing our needs, because after all, God knows everything. He knows our every need, and desires that we have the fullness of life. This is evident when Jesus compares the actions of a human parent, who only wants the best for his son, with our Father in Heaven who gives so much more. “What father among you would hand his son a snake when he asks for a fish? Or hand him a scorpion when he asks for an egg? … How much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?" God desires only the best for our lives, and doesn’t cause our misfortune, rather he looks for ways to help us through the struggles that we encounter from time to time. This is why Jesus believes that persistence in prayer is worthwhile, precisely because he knows God. He knows that God is not someone who is out of touch, unconcerned, unapproachable, but rather is a God of love and compassion, who desires only the best for our lives and who is there to accompany us when we find ourselves in the midst of a storm. 

So this morning, what might the Holy Spirit be asking of you? To open yourself to God’s purpose for your life? To trust that God is at work, even when it seems as if you are alone? To simply place yourself before the Lord, and trust that he will guide your path. 

Let us pray for the courage to draw closer to the Lord, to listen to the Lord as he accompanies us on our life journey, and to ask God for the grace that we need to deal with whatever life throws up. 🙏🏼🙏🏼

2022/07/31, 12:06 - +27 82 851 5315: Homily 18th Sunday C 2022 - Fr Jerry Browne

When I was preparing my homily, I came across a Roman proverb that says “_Money_ _is_ _like sea water; the more you drinks the thirstier you become_.” Somehow, tha proverb speaks to the danger of getting caught up in the pursuit of wealth. 

Dr. Carl Menninger, was a very well-known American psychiatrist who died in 1990. On one occasion he told the story of how he had treated an unhappy but very wealthy patient. He asked the patient what he was going to do with so much money. The patient replied, “Just worry about it, I suppose.” Menninger then asked, “Well, do you get much pleasure from worrying about it?” “No,” responded the patient, “but I get terrified when I think of giving some of it to somebody else.” 

Dr. Menninger went on to say something that is very insightful. He said, “Generous people are rarely mentally ill.” That is quite profound. “Generous people are rarely mentally ill.” There is a great truth in what he says. Think about it. People who cannot share with others, live very stressful lives. They are constantly fearful of losing their possessions, and the power and status that their wealth gives them, so much so, that they miss out on the joy that simple sharing brings to one’s life. 

In the parable that Jesus tells in today’s Gospel (Luke 12:13-21), God calls such people “fools.” The parable follows on directly from last Sundays’ gospel, where Jesus has been teaching his disciples how to pray, and is prompted by the question of someone in the crowd who asks Jesus a question about inheritance. Rather than get drawn into the role of arbitrator, Jesus uses the question to teach the people about the danger of greed and how the accumulation of wealth can distract a person for what is truly important in life. 

In the story, we meet a man whom, it seems, is not very interested in God, or anyone else for that matter. The rich man hasn’t committed any crime or done anything wrong in acquiring his wealth, he simply fails to realise that ‘life’ and ‘wealth’ are not the same thing, and while wealth may make life a little easier, it does not guarantee life. The parable condemns him for his self-centred indulgence, which is illustrate in the way that he even talks to himself! He asked himself, ‘What shall I do, for I do not have space to store my harvest?’” And then he says to himself “This is what I shall do: I shall tear down my barns and build larger ones. There I shall store all my grain and other goods and I shall say to my soul, “My soul, you have so many good things stored up for many years, take it easy, eat, drink, be merry!” 

It seems that the rich man’s wealth has given him a false sense of security. He not only thinks that his wealth has made him invincible, and that somehow it will allow him to determine his own future, but he also fails to realise that his wealth is a blessing – a gift from God – that is not meant to be hoarded, but like all gifts is meant to be shared. 

The man’s miscalculation is highlighted when, on one of those rare occasions that we hear God speak in a parable, the man’s thinking is scorned. God says “fool, this night your soul will be demanded from you.” And so it was! 

The reality is that we do not know the day or the hour when our life will end. While the parable sounds a warning about the frailty of life, its purpose is not to scare us, but to invite us to set our priorities, and to encourage us to reflect deeply on life’s true meaning. 

How many marriages fall apart, because one or both spouses are securing the future? How many children grow up alone / lonely, because their parents want to give them every ‘thing’, while failing to give them what they really need – time and love? Accumulation of wealth can give a temporary sense of security and purpose, but our true purpose has to do with our relationship with God and those we encounter in our daily lives. 

Throughout my life, it has become apparent to me that it is gratitude, and a generosity of spirit that leads to happiness. There is nothing wrong with having money or wealth. It is, however, the risk that our wealth promotes a selfishness in us that is the real danger. 

Gratitude is the remedy to selfishness. It helps us to not only use our gifts and talents  to help others, but also to understand that the blessings in our lives are gifts from God who loves us.  Gratitude deepens life. It enriches life, because it places all that we have in the context of God’s love, a love that will not abandon us no matter what comes our way.

So today, as we gather here, we take a moment again to reflect on our lives, perhaps to ask ourselves ‘what is it that preoccupies my life?’ Is it the stuff that I have accumulated? Is it protecting all that I have? Or am I blessed to realise the importance of my relationship with God, my family and those I meet every day?
